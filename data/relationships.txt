When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.
I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together.
Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.
I think you still love me, but we can’t escape the fact that I’m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I’m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I’m not angry, either. I should be, but I’m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong.
The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.
A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever
You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won't mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue.
For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home.
Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it.
It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it's so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn't coma back. You're left so alone that you can't explain. Damn, there's nothing like that, is there? I've been there and you have too. You're nodding your head.
We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, “This is the problem I want to have.”  I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way.
Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with.
I mean, if the relationship can't survive the long term, why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term?
Why is it," he said, one time, at the subway entrance, "I feel I've known you so many years?" "Because I like you," she said, "and I don't want anything from you.
When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you can like them for who they are.
The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too.
Every man I meet wants to protect me. I can't figure out what from.
There is greatness in doing something you hate for the sake of someone you love.
If conversation was the lyrics, laughter was the music, making time spent together a melody that could be replayed over and over without getting stale.
I know I am but summer to your heart, and not the full four seasons of the year.
It's no good pretending that any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently or if your favorite films wouldn't even speak to each other if they met at a party.
Come sleep with me: We won't make Love, Love will make us.
I will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face,I will treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. I will share your life with you, Meredith, and I will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine.
Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive.
Maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates and guys are just people to have fun with.
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous.
I’ve been fighting to be who I am all my life. What’s the point of being who I am, if I can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for?
I want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me.
I suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and that's it.
Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away... and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.... be happy about your growth, in which of course you can't take anyone with you, and be gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don't torment them with your doubts and don't frighten them with your faith or joy, which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn't necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust.... and don't expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it.
When we're incomplete, we're always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter.
Man, when you lose your laugh you lose your footing.
Every couple needs to argue now and then. Just to prove that the relationship is strong enough to survive. Long-term relationships, the ones that matter, are all about weathering the peaks and the valleys.
Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired, women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.
I know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother.
Maybe its like you said before, all of us being cracked open. Like each of us starts out as a watertight vessel. And then things happen - these people leave us, or don’t love us, or don’t get us, or we don’t get them, and we lose and fail and hurt one another. And the vessel starts to crack in places. And I mean, yeah once the vessel cracks open, the end becomes inevitable. Once it starts to rain inside the Osprey, it will never be remodeled. But there is all this time between when the cracks start to open up and when we finally fall apart. And its only that time that we see one another, because we see out of ourselves through our cracks and into others through theirs. When did we see each other face to face? Not until you saw into my cracks and I saw into yours. Before that we were just looking at ideas of each other, like looking at your window shade, but never seeing inside. But once the vessel cracks, the light can get in. The light can get out.
People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility.
Even though you may want to move forward in your life, you may have one foot on the brakes. In order to be free, we must learn how to let go. Release the hurt. Release the fear. Refuse to entertain your old pain. The energy it takes to hang onto the past is holding you back from a new life. What is it you would let go of today?
When you don't talk, there's a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said.
For there to be betrayal, there would have to have been trust first.
Usually adult males who are unable to make emotional connections with the women they choose to be intimate with are frozen in time, unable to allow themselves to love for fear that the loved one will abandon them. If the first woman they passionately loved, the mother, was not true to her bond of love, then how can they trust that their partner will be true to love. Often in their adult relationships these men act out again and again to test their partner's love. While the rejected adolescent boy imagines that he can no longer receive his mother's love because he is not worthy, as a grown man he may act out in ways that are unworthy and yet demand of the woman in his life that she offer him unconditional love. This testing does not heal the wound of the past, it merely reenacts it, for ultimately the woman will become weary of being tested and end the relationship, thus reenacting the abandonment. This drama confirms for many men that they cannot put their trust in love. They decide that it is better to put their faith in being powerful, in being dominant.
Cheating and lying aren't struggles, they're reasons to break up.
To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox. People eventually get sick of waiting, take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment become soulmates, which takes a lifetime to perfect.
Part of the problem with the word 'disabilities' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities.
Our wounds are often the openings into the best and most beautiful part of us.
Relationships dont always make sense. Especially from the outside
Every couple has ups and downs, every couple argues, and that’s the thing—you’re a couple, and couples can’t function without trust.
Lots of things can be fixed. Things can be fixed. But many times, relationships between people cannot be fixed, because they should not be fixed. You're aboard a ship setting sail, and the other person has joined the inland circus, or is boarding a different ship, and you just can't be with each other anymore. Because you shouldn't be.
I used to advertise my loyalty and I don't believe there is a single person I loved that I didn't eventually betray.
Those sweet lips. My, oh my, I could kiss those lips all night long.  Good things come to those who wait.
If a girl starts out all casual with a guy and she doesn't tell him that she wants a relationship, it will never become a relationship. If you give the guy the impression that casual is okay with you, that's all he'll ever want. Be straight with him from the start. If he gets scared and runs away, he wasn't right for you.
A dame that knows the ropes isn't likely to get tied up.
Relationships are mysterious. We doubt the positive qualities in others, seldom the negative. You will say to your partner: do you really love me? Are you sure you love me? You will ask this a dozen times and drive the person nuts. But you never ask: are you really mad at me? Are you sure you’re angry? When someone is angry, you don’t doubt it for a moment. Yet the reverse should be true. We should doubt the negative in life, and have faith in the positive.
I know my heart will never be the same But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
I may not always be with you  But when we're far apart Remember you will be with me Right inside my heart
If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, then you're allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind.
We die to each other daily. What we know of other people is only our memory of the moments during which we knew them. And they have changed since then. To pretend that they and we are the same is a useful and convenient social convention which must sometimes be broken. We must also remember that at every meeting we are meeting a stranger.
Women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them.
What we wait around a lifetime for with one person, we can find in a moment with someone else.
Forgive the past. It is over. Learn from it and let go. People are constantly changing and growing. Do not cling to a limited, disconnected, negative image of a person in the past. See that person now. Your relationship is always alive and changing.
I was suffering the easily foreseeable consequences. Addiction is the hallmark of every infatuation-based love story. It all begins when the object of your adoration bestows upon you a heady, hallucinogenic dose of something you never dared to admit you wanted-an emotional speedball, perhaps, of thunderous love and roiling excitement. Soon you start craving that intense attention, with a hungry obsession of any junkie. When the drug is witheld, you promptly turn sick, crazy, and depleted (not to mention resentful of the dealer who encouraged this addiction in the first place but now refuses to pony up the good stuff anymore-- despite the fact that you know he has it hidden somewhere, goddamn it, because he used to give it to you for free). Next stage finds you skinny and shaking in a corner, certain only that you would sell your soul or rob your neighbors just to have 'that thing' even one more time. Meanwhile, the object of your adoration has now become repulsed by you. He looks at you like you're someone he's never met before, much less someone he once loved with high passion. The irony is,you can hardly blame him. I mean, check yourself out. You're a pathetic mess,unrecognizable even to your own eyes. So that's it. You have now reached infatuation's final destination-- the complete and merciless devaluation of self." - pg 20-21
Of course it hurt that we could never love each other in a physical way. We would have been far more happy if we had. But that was like the tides, the change of seasons--something immutable, an immovable destiny we could never alter. No matter how cleverly we might shelter it, our delicate friendship wasn't going to last forever. We were bound to reach a dead end. That was painfully clear.
nothing in this world was more difficult than love.
I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart.
I care," he said in a trembling voice. "I care so much that I do not know how to tell you without it seeming inconsequential compared to how I feel. Even if I am distant at times and seem as if I do not want to be with you, it is only because this scares me, too.
Don't leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later; he may be with his real girlfriend.
Books are a poor substitute for female companionship, but they are easier to find.
Because I can't help doing it," he said with a shrug. "And hey, if I keep loving you, maybe you'll eventually crack and love me too. Hell, I'm pretty sure you're already half in love with me."  "I am not! And everything you just said is ridiculous. That's terrible logic."  Adrian returned to his crossword puzzle. "Well, you can think what you want, so long as you remember-no matter how ordinary things seem between us-I'm still here, still in love with you, and care about you more than any other guy, evil or otherwise, ever will."  "I don't think you're evil."  "See? Things are already looking promising.
It is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving, caring human being.
All I'm telling you to do is to be smart about it. Know that if this man isn't looking for a serious relationship, you're not going to change his mind just because you two are going on dates and being intimate. You could be the most perfect woman on the Lord's green earth-you're capable of interesting conversation, you cook a mean breakfast, you hand out backrubs like sandwiches, you're independent (which means, to him, that you're not going to be in his pockets)-but if he's not ready for a serious relationship, he going to treat you like sports fish.
He could totally be your boyfriend," [Angel] went on with annoying persistance. "You guys could get married. I could be like a junior bridesmaid. Total could be your flower dog." "I'm only a kid!" I shrieked. "I can't get married!" "You could in New Hampshire." My mouth dropped open. How does she know this stuff? "Forget it! No one's getting married!" I hissed. "Not in New Hampshire or anywhere else! Not in a box, not with a fox! Now go to sleep, <i>before I kill you!</i>
We kiss all the time." I clear my throat, then add, "We just...do it in private."  "A smug expression crosses his face. "I don't buy it for a second, 'cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin' in your house, I'd kiss you in front of the guy every chance I got as a reminder."  "A reminder of w-w-what?"  "That you were mine.
You’re just another story I can’t tell anymore.
Moving on is easy. It's staying moved on that's trickier.
How would your life be different if…You walked away from gossip and verbal defamation? Let today be the day…You speak only the good you know of other people and encourage others to do the same.
I find the best way to love someone is not to change them, but instead, help them reveal the greatest version of themselves.
Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken.
A fit, healthy body—that is the best fashion statement
We have to recognise that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment, unless there is loyalty, unless there is love, patience, persistence.
Sometimes it takes a heartbreak to shake us awake &amp; help us see we are worth so much more than we're settling for.
Every woman that finally figured out her worth, has picked up her suitcases of pride and boarded a flight to freedom, which landed in the valley of change.
We die containing a richness of lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have hidden in as if caves.   I wish for all this to be marked on by body when I am dead. I believe in such cartography - to be marked by nature, not just to label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings. We are communal histories, communal books. We are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience.
You can measure the happiness of a marriage by the number of scars that each partner carries on their tongues, earned from years of biting back angry words.
only someone who is ready for everything, who doesn't exclude any experience, even the most incomprehensible, will live the relationship with another person as something alive and will himself sound the depths of his own being.
I felt like an animal, and animals don’t know sin, do they?
This is what happened in love. One of you cried a lot and then both of you grew sarcastic.
When we face pain in relationships our first response is often to sever bonds rather than to maintain commitment. 
It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished.
It's probably a bad indicator of your lifestyle when you miss your ex-boyfriend because he's absolutely lethal.
Most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories.
If you need something from somebody always give that person a way to hand it to you.
There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it.
Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman who'll give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you're in the wrong house, that's what it means.
Mocking a woman is like drinking too much wine. It may be fun for a short time, but the hangover is hell.
When you hold a grudge, you want someone else’s sorrow to reflect your level of hurt but the two rarely meet.
That's when I finally got it. I finally understood. It wasn't the thought that counted. It was the actual execution that mattered, the showing up for somebody. The intent behind it wasn't enough. Not for me. Not anymore. It wasn't enough to know that deep down, he loved me. You had to actually say it to somebody, show them you cared. And he just didn't. Not enough.
When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity.
A busy, vibrant, goal-oriented woman is so much more attractive than a woman who waits around for a man to validate her existence.
you can take this mouth this wound you want but you can't kiss and make it better.
Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings. By living with you, I want to learn to love everyone and all species. If I succeed in loving you, I will be able to love everyone and all species on Earth... This is the real message of love.
He knew one of the women well, and had shared his universe with her. They had seen the same mountains, and the same trees, although each of them had seem them differently. She knew his weaknesses, his moments of hatred, of despair. Yet she was there at his side. They shared the same universe.
There are so many things that demand to be said. Where did you go? Do you ever think about me? You've ruined me. Are you okay? But of course, I can't say any of that.
V-Day…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for “your loved one” I think it’s quite stupid. I hate this commercialism. It’s all artificial, and has nothing to do with real love.
Failed relationships can be described as so much wasted make-up.
Statistically speaking, there is a 65 percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair. Be very suspicious.
<b>misgivings</b>, <i>n</i>.  Last night, I got up the courage to ask you if you regretted us.  "There are things I miss," you said. "But if I didn't have you, I'd miss more.
Six hundred and forty fish later, the only thing I know is everything you love will die. The first time you meet someone special, you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground.
Can officially confirm that the way to a man's heart these days is not through beauty, food, sex, or alluringness of character, but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him.
I define connection as the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment; and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship.
The best relationships in our lives are the best not because they have been the happiest ones, they are that way because they have stayed strong through the most tormentful of storms.
When you struggle with your partner, you are struggling with yourself. Every fault you see in them touches a denied weakness in yourself.
I want to be around people that do things. I don’t want to be around people anymore that judge or talk about what people do. I want to be around people that dream and support and do things.
And then the line was quite but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone.
A true gentleman is one that apologizes anyways, even though he has not offended a lady intentionally. He is in a class all of his own because he knows the value of a woman's heart.
I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.
People die, I think, but your relationship with them doesn't. It continues and is ever-changing.
He wasn't the type for displays of affection, either verbal or not. He was disgusted by couples that made out in the hallways between classes, and got annoyed at even the slightest sappy moments in movies. But I knew he cared about me: he just conveyed it more subtly, as concise with expressing this emotion as he was with everything else. It was in the way he'd put his hand on the small of my back, for instance, or how he'd smile at me when I said something that surprised him. Once I might have wanted more, but I'd come around to his way of thinking in the time we'd been together. And we were together, all the time. So he didn't have to prove how he felt about me. Like so much else, I should just know.
We all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everyhwere.
When you find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will stand in front of you when other’s cast stones, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who will hold your hand when your sick, who thinks your pretty without makeup, the one who turns to his friends and say, ‘that’s her’, the one that would bear your rejection because losing you means losing his will to live, who kisses you when you screw up, watches the stars and names one for you and will hold and rock that baby for hours so you can sleep…..you marry him all over again.
I won't telephone him. I'll never telephone him again as long as I live. He'll rot in hell, before I'll call him up. You don't have to give me strength, God; I have it myself. If he wanted me, he could get me. He knows where I am. He knows I'm waiting here. He's so sure of me, so sure. I wonder why they hate you, as soon as they are sure of you.
He loved her for almost everything she was &amp; she decided that was enough to let him stay for a very long time.
Unrequited love is the infinite curse of a lonely heart.
Love doesn't mean anything if you're not willing to make a commitment, and you have to think not only about what you want, but about what he wants. Not just now, but in the future.
That's why I loved being with you. We could do the simplest things, like toss starfish into the ocean and share a burger and talk and even then I knew that I was fortunate. Because you were the first guy who wasn't constantly trying to impress me. You accepted who you were, but more than that, you accepted me for me. And nothing else mattered-- not my family or your family or anyone else in the world. It was just us.
When what you hear and what you see don't match, trust your eyes.
Lonely people tend, rather, to be lonely because they decline to bear the psychic costs of being around other humans. They are allergic to people. People affect them too strongly.
When God knows you're ready for the responsibility of commitment, He'll reveal the right person under the right circumstances.
Don't worry about hurting me, if that's what you're afraid of. I want to get hurt. At least I´ll feel something for a change.
You Can't Lose Something You Never Had
You fit into me like a hook into an eye a fish hook an open eye
Annabeth,” he said hesitantly, “in New Rome, demigods can live their whole lives in peace.”  Her expression turned guarded. “Reyna explained it to me. But, Percy, you belong at Camp Half-Blood. That other life—” “I know,” Percy said. “But while I was there, I saw so many demigods living without fear: kids going to college, couples getting married and raising families. There’s nothing like that at Camp Half-Blood. I kept thinking about you and me…and maybe someday when this war with the giants is over…” It was hard to tell in the golden light, but he thought Annabeth was blushing. “Oh,” she said… “I’m sorry,” he said. “I just…I had to think of that to keep going. To give me hope. Forget I mentioned—” “No!” she said. “Gods, Percy, that’s so sweet.
Hope for love, pray for love, wish for love, dream for love…but don’t put your life on hold waiting for love.
We ruined each other by being together. We destroyed each other’s dreams.
I got my heart's desire, and there my troubles began.
Trust is the fruit of a relationship in which you know you are loved.
I cannot have a man who is afraid of everything, I don't have the time to soothe insecurities and fears, I cannot have a man who is standing on a stone by a creek, watching for the fish to swim by and every time he sees a fish he says "Oh look, this fish scares me, I wonder what this fish means, this fish might mean- this, or this fish might mean- that" for God's sake, they are just fish, and they don't mean anything! Such a sad thing, so many fine, strong men standing on top of little stones, pointing at fish all the time! Such a waste! Such a waste of time! I can only have a man who will leap into the water, not minding the damn fish and whatever other little things that scare him. I need to have someone who is braver than me; if I am a pirate, he has to be the pirate Captain, if I am a pirate Captain he has to be the flying dragon.
Last night I was seriously considering whether I was a bisexual or not but I don’t think so though I’m not sure if I’d like to be and argh I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, if you like a person, you like the person, not their genitals.
I just...I just miss him. And I hate being so alone.
One of the best times for figuring out who you are &amp; what you really want out of life? Right after a break-up.
My head’ll explode if I continue with this escapism.
Sometimes I get real lonely sleeping with you.
Rejection is an opportunity for your selection.
If you're trapped in the dream of the Other, you're fucked.
Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships.
The words ‘I Love You’ kill, and resurrect millions, in less than a second.
That night when you kissed me, I left a poem in your mouth, and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out.
Wanting him to come back before anyone notices part of the world has not moved since he left.
An unarticulated crush is very different from an unrequited one, because at least with an unrequited crush you know what the hell you're doing, even if the other person isn't doing it back. An unarticulated crush is harder to grapple with, because it's a crush that you haven't even admitted to yourself. The romantic forces are all there -- you want to see him, you always notice him, you treat every word from him as if it weighs more than anyone else's. But you don't know why. You don't know that you're doing it. You'd follow him to the end of the earth without ever admitting that your feet were moving.
Oh, you know. Jace reminds me of an old boyfriend. Some guys look at you like they want sex. Jace looks at you like you've already <i>had</i> sex, it was great, and now you're just friends--even though you want more. Drives girls crazy. You know what I mean?"  <i>Yes,</i> Clary thought. "No," she said.  pg. 280
If equal affection cannot be, Let the more loving one be me.
You couldn't just pick and choose at will when someone depended on you, or loved you. It wasn't like a light switch, easy to turn on or off. If you were in, you were in. Out, you were out.
You know that when I hate you, it is because I love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul.
When you loved someone and had to let them go, there will always be that small part of yourself that whispers, "What was it that you wanted and why didn't you fight for it?
Perfectly Imperfect  We have all heard that no two snowflakes are alike. Each snowflake takes the perfect form for the maximum efficiency and effectiveness for its journey. And while the universal force of gravity gives them a shared destination, the expansive space in the air gives each snowflake the opportunity to take their own path. They are on the same journey, but each takes a different path. Along this gravity-driven journey, some snowflakes collide and damage each other, some collide and join together, some are influenced by wind... there are so many transitions and changes that take place along the journey of the snowflake. But, no matter what the transition, the snowflake always finds itself perfectly shaped for its journey.  I find parallels in nature to be a beautiful reflection of grand orchestration. One of these parallels is of snowflakes and us. We, too, are all headed in the same direction. We are being driven by a universal force to the same destination. We are all individuals taking different journeys and along our journey, we sometimes bump into each other, we cross paths, we become altered... we take different physical forms. But at all times we too are 100% perfectly imperfect. At every given moment we are absolutely perfect for what is required for our journey. I’m not perfect for your journey and you’re not perfect for my journey, but I’m perfect for my journey and you’re perfect for your journey. We’re heading to the same place, we’re taking different routes, but we’re both exactly perfect the way we are.  Think of what understanding this great orchestration could mean for relationships. Imagine interacting with others knowing that they too each share this parallel with the snowflake. Like you, they are headed to the same place and no matter what they may appear like to you, they have taken the perfect form for their journey. How strong our relationships would be if we could see and respect that we are all perfectly imperfect for our journey.
I love you. I hate you. I like you. I hate you. I love you. I think you’re stupid. I think you’re a loser. I think you’re wonderful. I want to be with you. I don’t want to be with you. I would never date you. I hate you. I love you…..I think the madness started the moment we met and you shook my hand. Did you have a disease or something?
My girlfriend is sad and quiet and keeps me up all night worrying about her.
Submission is not about authority and it is not obedience; it is all about relationships of love and respect.
Most men claim to desire driven, independent and confident women. Yet when confronted with such a creature reverence often evolves into resent. For just like women, men need to be needed.
She was a beautiful dreamer. The kind of girl, who kept her head in the clouds, loved above the stars and left regret beneath the earth she walked on.
She was the third beer. Not the first one, which the throat receives with almost tearful gratitude; nor the second, that confirms and extends the pleasure of the first. But the third, the one you drink because it's there, because it can't hurt, and because what difference does it make?
Intimacy is the capacity to be rather weird with someone - and finding that that's ok with them.
We know from daily life that we exist for other people first of all, for whose smiles and well-being our own happiness depends.
Someone real," I hear myself saying. "Someone who never has to pretend, and who I never have to pretend around. Someone who's smart, but knows how to laugh at himself. Someone who would listen to a symphony and start to cry, because he understands music can be too big for words. Someone who knows me better than I know myself. Someone I want to talk to first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Someone I feel like I've known my whole life, even if I haven't.
Have you ever noticed how parents can go from the most wonderful people in the world to totally embarrassing in three seconds?
Love. Not the kind you see in the movies or hear about on the radio. The real kind. The kind that gets beaten down and bloody, yet perseveres. The kind that hopes even when hope seems foolish. The kind that can forgive. The kind that believes in healing.  The kind that can sit in silence and feel renewed. The real kind of love. It's rare and we have it...
The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror.
How could I be sleeping with this particular man.... Surely only true love could justify my lack of taste.
I believe in love the verb, not the noun.
Physical love is unthinkable without violence.
We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste!
Thought I couldn't live without you It's gonna hurt when it heals too Even though I really love you I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to Quickly I'm learning to love again All I know is I'mma be ok
Because introverts are typically good listeners and, at least, have the appearance of calmness, we are attractive to emotionally needy people. Introverts, gratified that other people are initiating with them, can easily get caught in these exhausting and unsatisfying relationships.
Because isn’t that the point of every relationship: to be known by someone else, to be understood? He gets me. She gets me. Isn’t that the simple magic phrase?
I would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy. The passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something. We grow from hot or cold, but lukewarm is the biggest insult.
<b>Frida Kahlo to Marty McConnell</b>  leaving is not enough; you must stay gone. train your heart like a dog. change the locks even on the house he’s never visited. you lucky, lucky girl. you have an apartment just your size. a bathtub full of tea. a heart the size of Arizona, but not nearly so arid. don’t wish away your cracked past, your crooked toes, your problems are papier mache puppets you made or bought because the vendor at the market was so compelling you just had to have them. you had to have him. and you did. and now you pull down the bridge between your houses, you make him call before he visits, you take a lover for granted, you take a lover who looks at you like maybe you are magic. make the first bottle you consume in this place a relic. place it on whatever altar you fashion with a knife and five cranberries. don’t lose too much weight. stupid girls are always trying to disappear as revenge. and you are not stupid. you loved a man with more hands than a parade of beggars, and here you stand. heart like a four-poster bed. heart like a canvas. heart leaking something so strong they can smell it in the street.
Learn to deal with the fact that you are not a perfect person but you are a person that deserves respect and honesty.
Sometimes the one who is running from the Life/Death/Life nature insists on thinking of love as a boon only. Yet love in its fullest form is a series of deaths and rebirths. We let go of one phase, one aspect of love, and enter another. Passion dies and is brought back. Pain is chased away and surfaces another time. To love means to embrace and at the same time to withstand many endings, and many many beginnings- all in the same relationship.
What you want most you push away from you. You want more than you care to admit.
The quickest way to rectify that mistake (choosing the wrong person) is by learning from that, moving on, and choosing much more wisely in the future.
Assumptions are the termites of relationships.
Certainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred's a subset of self pity and not the other way around - ' It destroys everything around it, except itself '.   Self pity will destroy relationships, it'll destroy anything that's good, it will fulfill all the prophecies it makes and leave only itself. And it's so simple to imagine that one is hard done by, and that things are unfair, and that one is underappreciated, and that if only one had had a chance at this, only one had had a chance at that, things would have gone better, you would be happier if only this, that one is unlucky. All those things. And some of them may well even be true. But, to pity oneself as a result of them is to do oneself an enormous disservice.  I think it's one of things we find unattractive about the american culture, a culture which I find mostly, extremely attractive, and I like americans and I love being in america. But, just occasionally there will be some example of the absolutely ravening self pity that they are capable of, and you see it in their talk shows. It's an appalling spectacle, and it's so self destructive. I almost once wanted to publish a self help book saying 'How To Be Happy by Stephen Fry : Guaranteed success'. And people buy this huge book and it's all blank pages, and the first page would just say - ' Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself - And you will be happy '. Use the rest of the book to write down your interesting thoughts and drawings, and that's what the book would be, and it would be true. And it sounds like 'Oh that's so simple', because it's not simple to stop feeling sorry for yourself, it's bloody hard. Because we do feel sorry for ourselves, it's what Genesis is all about.
I suppose that since most of our hurts come through relationships so will our healing, and I know that grace rarely makes sense for those looking in from the outside.
If a man, who says he loves you, won’t tell you the details of a private conversation between him and another woman you can be sure he is not protecting your heart. He is protecting himself and the women he has feelings for. Wise women simply see things as they are, not as their low self-esteem allows.
No matter how close we are to another person, few human relationships are as free from strife, disagreement, and frustration as is the relationship you have with a good dog. Few human beings give of themselves to another as a dog gives of itself. I also suspect that we cherish dogs because their unblemished souls make us wish - consciously or unconsciously - that we were as innocent as they are, and make us yearn for a place where innocence is universal and where the meanness, the betrayals, and the cruelties of this world are unknown.
This love of which I speak is slow to lose patience - it looks for a way of being constructive. Love is not possessive. Love is not anxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own ideas. Love has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage. Love is not touchy. Love does not keep account of evil or gloat over the wickedness of other people. On the contrary, it is glad with all good men when truth prevails. Love knows no limits to its endurance, no end to its trust, no fading of its hope; it can outlast anything. It is, in fact, the one thing that stands when all else has fallen.
And now you are and I am and we're a mystery which will never happen again.
We are not written for one instrument alone; I am not, neither are you.
I believe in the immeasurable power of love; that true love can endure any circumstance and reach across any distance.
Love cannot live where there is no trust.
I'm not crying because of you; you're not worth it. I'm crying because my delusion of who you were was shattered by the truth of who you are.
If a man can possess a woman sexually -really possess- he won't need to control her ideas, her opinions, her clothes, her friends, even her other lovers.
But why, why, why can't people just say what they mean?
Some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never ever the same.
You think that holding someone hard will bring them closer. You think that you can hold them so hard that you'll still feel them, embossed on you, when you pull away. Every time Eleanor pulled away from Park, she felt the gasping loss of him.
But in the real world, you couldnt really just split a family down the middle, mom on one side, dad the other, with the child equally divided between. It was like when you ripped a piece of paper into two: no matter how you tried, the seams never fit exactly right again. It was what you couldn't see, those tiniest of pieces, that were lost in the severing, and their absence kept everything from being complete.
Siblings: children of the same parents, each of whom is perfectly normal until they get together.
Caring about someone isn't complicated. It isn't easy. But it isn't complicated, either. Kinda like lifting the engine block out of a car.
Mutual caring relationships require kindness and patience, tolerance, optimism, joy in the other's achievements, confidence in oneself, and the ability to give without undue thought of gain.
If you spend your life sparing people’s feelings and feeding their vanity, you get so you can’t distinguish what should be respected in them.
Why don’t we break up? I guess I stay with her because she stays with me. And that’s not an easy thing to do.
Your absence has not taught me to be alone, it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall.
Right now we are here, and nothing can mar our perfection, or steal the joy of this perfect moment.
<b>contiguous</b>, <i>adj</i>.  I felt silly for even mentioning it, but once I did, I knew I had to explain.  "When I was a kid, "I had this puzzle with all fifty states on it--you know, the kind where you have to fit them all together. And one day I got it in my head that California and Nevada were in love. I told my mom, and she had no idea what I was talking about. I ran and got those two pieces and showed it to her--California and Nevada, completely in love. So a lot of the time when we're like this"--my ankles against the backs of your ankles, my knees fitting into the backs of your knees, my thighs on the backs of your legs, my stomach against your back, my chin folding into your neck--"I can't help but think about California and Nevada, and how we're a lot like them. If someone were drawing us from above as a map. that's what we'd look like; that's how we are."   For a moment, you were quiet. And then you nestled in and whispered.  "Contiguous."  And I knew you understood.
The end of a relationship is not always a failure. Sometimes all the love in the world is not enough to save something. In these cases, it is not a matter of fault from either person. Some things cannot be, it's as simple as that.
Often men who have been emotionally neglected and abused as children by dominating mothers bond with assertive women, only to have their childhood feelings of being engulfed surface. While they could not 'smash their mommy' and still receive love, they find that they can engage in intimate violence with partners who respond to their acting out by trying harder to connect with them emotionally, hoping that the love offered in the present will heal the wounds of the past. If only one party in the relationship is working to create love, to create the space of emotional connection, the dominator model remains in place and the relationship just becomes a site for continuous power struggle.
Falling in love in a Christian way is to say,'I am excited about your future and I want to be part of getting you there. I'm signing up for the journey with you. Would you sign up for the journey to my true self with me? It's going to be hard but I want to get there.
But whenever I meet dynamic, nonretarded Americans, I notice that they all seem to share a single unifying characteristic: the inability to experience the kind of mind-blowing, transcendent romantic relationship they perceive to be a normal part of living. And someone needs to take the fall for this. So instead of blaming no one for this (which is kind of cowardly) or blaming everyone (which is kind of meaningless), I'm going to blame John Cusack.
You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.
Love is a commitment that will be tested in the most vulnerable areas of spirituality, a commitment that will force you to make some very difficult choices. It is a commitment that demands that you deal with your lust, your greed, your pride, your power, your desire to control, your temper, your patience, and every area of temptation that the Bible clearly talks about. It demands the quality of commitment that Jesus demonstrates in His relationship to us.
...the opposite of love is not hate -- it's apathy. It's not giving a damn. If somebody hates me, they must "feel" something ... or they couldn't possibly hate. Therefore, there's some way in which I can get to them.
It’s hard to communicate anything exactly and that’s why perfect relationships between people are difficult to find.
Maybe you could be mine / or maybe we’ll be entwined / aimless in this sexless foreplay.
It's just the most amazing thing to love a dog, isn't it? It makes our relationships with people seem as boring as a bowl of oatmeal.
Yes, it's a well-known fact about you: you're like death, you take everything.
If I never see you again  I will always carry you inside outside  on my fingertips and at brain edges  and in centers centers of what I am of what remains.
I don't understand dating.. and the other things that people do.. all I know is that you ought to find the one you recognize. The one who gives you four arms, four legs, four eyes, and has the other half of your heart. There's only one of those, so what are all the other things for? Like dating?
Being single doesn't mean you're weak, it means that you're strong enough to wait for the right person.
I hope we'll be friends forever, together we'll always be. I don't think you understand just how much you mean to me. And one day when we part our ways, we'll think back to the past and think about how happy we are 'cause our friendship will always last.
When forever becomes a place...when forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts... that is a reflection of true love.
All I want from you is to trust me with what little you can, and grow in loving people around you with the same love I share with you. It's not your job to change them, or to convince them. You are free to love without an agenda.
Husbands are chiefly good as lovers when they are betraying their wives.
Love lasts about seven years. That's how long it takes for the cells of the body to totally replace themselves.
We met each other when we were young, before we knew enough about disappointment, and once we did we found we reminded each other of it.
And for that one moment of freedom you have to listen to all that love crap... it drive me nuts sometimes... I want to kick them out immediately... I do now and then. But that doesn't keep them away. They like it, in fact. The less you notice them the more they chase after you. There's something perverse about women... they're all masochists at heart.
..he may love you, he may miss you, but ultimately he's just not that into you.
I didn't know someone could love me like this," she said. "Could love me and love me and love me without...needing space." Lincoln wasn't asleep. He rolled on top of her. "There's no air in space," he said.
Single is no longer a lack of options – but a choice. A choice to refuse to let your life be defined by your relationship status but to live every day Happily and let your Ever After work itself out.
Ultimately the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or in friendship, is conversation, and conversation must have a common basis, and between two people of widely different culture the only common basis possible is the lowest level.
Words were weapons, his father had taught him that, and he'd wanted to hurt Clary more than he'd ever wanted to hurt any girl. In fact, he wasn't sure he had ever wanted to hurt a girl before. Usually he just wanted them, and then he wanted them to leave him alone.
I believe with all my heart that the cliches are true, that we are our own best friends and best company, and that if you're not right for yourself, it's impossible to be right for anyone.
Please, touch me, I pray.
How could you love us being together?" he asked me "We are nothing alike and we are not meant for each other and we drive each other crazy, you love that? How can you love that?" So I told him "I know that we're not meant for each other, that we drive each other crazy, and that we are so different. But that's us. That's what we have; a wild nonsense. We are not good together, but together we are bad for each other. I love us together this way just like this. Because even if it's no good, it's what we have! It's us.
When we fail to set boundaries and hold people accountable, we feel used and mistreated. This is why we sometimes attack who they are, which is far more hurtful than addressing a behavior or a choice.
Every now and then, I’d meet a guy and think that we were getting along great, and suddenly I’d stop hearing from him. Not only did he stop calling, but if I happened to bump into him sometime later he always acted like I had the plague. I didn’t understand it. I still don’t. And it bothered me. It hurt me. With time, it got harder and harder to keep blaming the guys, and I eventually came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with me. That maybe I was simply meant to live my life alone.
I make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep.
She asked if I loved another woman, so I answered honestly and said, “Dinner was great, but I could go for dessert.
Hugh and I have been together for so long that in order to arouse extraordinary passion, we need to engage in physical combat. Once, he hit me on the back of the head with a broken wineglass, and I fell to the floor pretending to be unconscious. That was romantic, or would have been had he rushed to my side rather than stepping over my body to fetch the dustpan.
It's not your job to like me - it's mine
You can be in love and you can be in a relationship. But they’re not always the same thing.
A man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman. A woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man.
I could’ve sworn I was telling the truth when I told you I didn’t miss you.
To wisely live your life, you don't need to know much Just remember two main rules for the beginning: You better starve, than eat whatever And better be alone, than with whoever.
I used to think I knew everything. I was a "smart person" who "got things done," and because of that, the higher I climbed, the more I could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple, even religion. But I realized something as I drove home that night: that I am neither better nor smarter, only luckier. And I should be ashamed of thinking I knew everything, because you can know the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain-no matter how smart or accomplished-they cry, they yearn, they hurt.But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things:comfort, love, and a peaceful heart.
But it is impossible to go through life without trust; that is to be imprisoned in the worst cell of all, oneself.
I suppose it’s not a social norm, and not a manly thing to do — to feel, discuss feelings. So that’s what I’m giving the finger to. Social norms and stuff…what good are social norms, really? I think all they do is project a limited and harmful image of people. It thus impedes a broader social acceptance of what someone, or a group of people, might actually be like.
The most important relationship in your life is the relationship you have with yourself. Because no matter what happens, you will always be with yourself.
Death is the easy part, the hard part is living and knowing you could be so much more then you’re willing to be.
There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that.
He knew me in all the ways that truly mattered: the shape of my fears, the contours of my dreams.
When you say "I" and "my" too much, you lose the capacity to understand the "we" and "our".
Be sure it's your real self you're showing. Because it is your real self that needs to be loved.
Find a woman who makes you feel more alive. She won't make life perfect but she'll make it infinitely more interesting. And then love her with all that's in you.
Love without sacrifice is like theft
Her face looked ugly in the attempt to avoid tears; it was an ugliness which bound him to her more than any beauty could have done. It isn't being happy together, he thought as though it were a fresh discovery, that makes one love--it's being unhappy together.
I once loved a girl who almost loved me, but not as much as she loved John Cusack.
The true measure of a man is how he treats you when others are not looking.
No matter how much you love someone, you still want to have you own way.
Human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments, a future - and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people.
There are all kinds of ways for a relationship to be tested, even broken, some, irrevocably; it’s the endings we’re unprepared for.
Intimacy requires courage because risk is inescapable. We cannot know at the outset how the relationship will affect us. Like a chemical mixture, if one of us is changed, both of us will be. Will we grow in self-actualization, or will it destroy us? The one thing we can be certain of is that if we let ourselves fully into the relationship for good or evil, we will not come out unaffected.
The desire to love someone always exceeds the desire to be loved by someone &amp; that's exactly why we end up loving the person who doesn't deserve that LOVE.
People will walk in and walk out of your life, but the one whose footstep made a long lasting impression is the one you should never allow to walk out.
Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper or you come home to Manderley with me." "Do you mean you want a secretary or something?" "No, I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.
Lately I can't help wanting us to be like other people. For example, if I were a smoker,  you'd lift a match to the cigarette just as I put it between my lips. It's never been like that  between us: none of that easy chemistry, no quick, half automatic flares. Everything between us  had to be learned. Saturday finds me brooding behind my book, all my fantasies  of seduction run up against the rocks. Tell me again  why you don't like sex in the afternoon? No, don't tell me--  I'll never understand you never understand us, America's strangest loving couple: they never  drink a bottle of wine together and rarely look at each other. Into each other's eyes, I mean.
I had a dream about you. You were an escalator, and I was a flight of stairs. You thought I was a Luddite, and I thought I was as ostrich, because I hadn’t figured out how to put the fly in flight. One day you broke down, and then you saw that you and I weren’t so different after all.
You know someone's right for you when the things they don't <i>have</i> to say are even more important than the things they do.
I never hated a man enough to give him his diamonds back.
The best you can hope for in a relationship is to find someone whose flaws are the sort you don’t mind. It is futile to look for someone who has no flaws, or someone who is capable of significant change; that sort of person exists only in our imaginations.
I realized I’m in love. It's always been right in front of me.
Share your weaknesses. Share your hard moments. Share your real side. It'll either scare away every fake person in your life or it will inspire them to finally let go of that mirage called "perfection," which will open the doors to the most important relationships you'll ever be a part of.
How would your life be different if…You approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty? Let today be the day…You dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity.
Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken.
Share too much and someone can hurt you.
Sometimes to self-discover you must self-destruct.
It can be difficult to leave a long-term relationship, even when our inner-wisdom tells us it's time to let go. At this point, we can choose let go and endure the intense pain of leaving behind the familiar to make way for a new chapter in our life. Or we can stay and suffer a low-grade pain that slowly eats away at our heart and soul, like an emotional cancer. Until we wake up, one day and realize, we are buried so deep in the dysfunction of the relationship that we scarcely remember who we were and what we wanted and needed to be.
There is an emotional promiscuity we’ve noticed among many good young men and women. The young man understands something of the journey of the heart. He wants to talk, to “share the journey.” The woman is grateful to be pursued, she opens up. They share the intimacies of their lives - their wounds, their walks with God. But he never commits. He enjoys her... then leaves. And she wonders, What did I do wrong? She failed to see his passivity. He really did not ever commit or offer assurances that he would. Like Willoughby to Marianne in Sense and Sensibility.  Be careful you do not offer too much of yourself to a man until you have good, solid evidence that he is a strong man willing to commit. Look at his track record with other women. Is there anything to be concerned about there? If so, bring it up. Also, does he have any close male friends - and what are they like as men? Can he hold down a job? Is he walking with God in a real and intimate way? Is he facing the wounds of his own life, and is he also demonstrating a desire to repent of Adam’s passivity and/or violence? Is he headed somewhere with his life? A lot of questions, but your heart is a treasure, and we want you to offer it only to a man who is worthy and ready to handle it well.
People are islands,' she said. 'They don't really touch. However close they are, they're really quite separate. Even if they've been married for fifty years.
Better to put your heart on the line, risk everything, and walk away with nothing than play it safe. Love is a lot of things, but “safe” isn’t one of them.
They hurt you. You hurt 'em back. Or maybe it is the other way around. Whatever. Someday you might find a way to forgive each other. But it won't be like it used to 'cause that pain never really goes away.
You want to take me to a movie?" I asked.  "Well, not really," he said. "What I really want is for you to be my girlfriend. But I thought saying that might scare you off.
A woman can become a man's friend only in the following stages - first an acquantaince, next a mistress, and only then a friend.
A tamed woman will never leave her mark in the world.
He doesn't need to be reminded you're great.
So many believe that it is love that grows, but it is the knowing that grows and love simply expands to contain it.
So often survivors have had their experiences denied, trivialized, or distorted. Writing is an important avenue for healing because it gives you the opportunity to define your own reality. You can say: This did happen to me. It was that bad. It was the fault &amp; responsibility of the adult. I was—and am—innocent.” The Courage to Heal by Ellen Bass &amp; Laura Davis
Two separate beings, in different circumstances, face to face in freedom and seeking justification of their existence through one another, will always live an adventure full of risk and promise." (p. 248)
The real thing that keeps men and women apart, is fear. Women blame men and men blame women, but the culprit is fear, women are afraid of one thing, men are afraid of a different thing; the fears of women have to do with losing while the fears of men have to do with not being good enough for something. One is loss, the other is insecurity. Men are innately more insecure than women and women are innately more needful of companionship than men. It's good for both men and women to be able to recognize and identify these fears not only within themselves, but within each other, and then men and women will see that they really do need to help each other. It's not a game, it's not a competition, the two sexes need one another.
Why does anyone stay in an unhappy relationship? Because people do. They do it all the time. And the truth is, when you’re in it, when you’re up to your neck in the everyday part of life with another human being, sometimes you don’t exactly notice how bad things really are. It’s not always as apparent as it would seem. Unhappiness, when it involves another person, can be like that line from The Sun Also Rises about going bankrupt, how it happens two ways: gradually, and then suddenly.
What a relationship looks like on the outside isn't the same as what it's like on the inside. You can be more in love with someone in your mind than with the person you see every day.
The more you talk about it, rehash it, rethink it, cross analyze it, debate it, respond to it, get paranoid about it, compete with it, complain about it, immortalize it, cry over it, kick it, defame it, stalk it, gossip about it, pray over it, put it down or dissect its motives it continues to rot in your brain. It is dead. It is over. It is gone. It is done. It is time to bury it because it is smelling up your life and no one wants to be near your rotted corpse of memories and decaying attitude. Be the funeral director of your life and bury that thing!
We know so little about one another. We embrace a shadow and love a dream.
I remember one desolate Sunday night, wondering: Is this how I´m going to spend the rest of my life? Marrid to someone who is perpetually distracted and somewhat wistful, as though a marvelous party is going on in the next room, which but for me he could be attending?
The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum, and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world.
Love doesn’t have to be on Valentine’s Day. It doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirty-three or fifty-nine. It doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual. It doesn’t have to be kismet at once, or rhapsody by the third day.  It just has to be. In time. In place. In spirt.  It just has to be.
Relationships take up energy; letting go of them, psychiatrists theorize, entails mental work. When you lose someone you were close to, you have to reassess your picture of the world and your place in it. The more your identity was wrapped up with the deceased, the more difficult the loss.
They lay silently. She was staring at something across the room. She was making him feel uncomfortable. 'It wouldn't work. It's the attraction of opposites,' he said.  We're not opposites.'  I don't mean just you and me. Women fall in love when they get to know you. Men are just the opposite. When they finally know you they're ready to leave.
If you're right &amp; I'm not, I'm going to be hell to live with, she said. So, you better think about that next time you want to be right.
It’s all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you, rather than looking for love to compensate for a self love deficit.
If he can't handle you at your worst then he does not deserve you at your best. Real love means seeing beyond the words spoken out of pain, and instead seeing a person's soul.
I miss you in waves and tonight I’m drowning. You left me fending for my life and it feels like you’re the only one who can bring me back to the shore alive.
Life contains but two tragedies. One is not to get your heart’s desire; the other is to get it.
Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. The soul of feminist politics is the commitment to ending patriarchal domination of women and men, girls and boys. Love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion. Males cannot love themselves in patriarchal culture if their very self-definition relies on submission to patriarchal rules. When men embrace feminist thinking and preactice, which emphasizes the value of mutual growth and self-actualization in all relationships, their emotional well-being will be enhanced. A genuine feminist politics always brings us from bondage to freedom, from lovelessness to loving.
Tell me whom you haunt and I’ll tell you who you are.
Laughter is more than just a pleasurable activity...When people laugh together, they tend to talk and touch more and to make eye contact more frequently.
Somewhere along the way we all go a bit mad. So burn, let go and dive into the horror, because maybe it’s the chaos which helps us find where we belong.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
Funny how we take it for granted that we know all there is to know about another person, just because we see them frequently or because of some strong emotional tie.
In this story I am the poet You're the poetry.
I used to think--and given the way we ended up, maybe I still do--that all relationships need the kind of violent shove that a crush brings, just to get you started and to push you over the humps. And then, when the energy from that shove has gone and you come to something approaching a halt, you have to look around and see what you've got. It could be something completely different, it could be something roughly the same, but gentler and calmer, or it could be nothing at all.
The best kind of humans are the ones who stay.
We swallowed the chaos because we knew we didn't want to be ordinary.
You'll blow up a helicopter, but you won't go out with me? What is <i> wrong </i> with you?
We walked to meet each other up at the time of our love and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions, and there's no altering that.
This emotion I'm feeling now, this is love, right?"  "I don't know. Is it a longing? Is it a giddy stupid happiness just because you're with me?"  "Yes," she said.  "That's influenza," said Miro. "Watch for nausea or diarrhea within a few hours.
Your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on. Your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go. However, your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back.
It seems to me that if you place music (and books, probably, and films, and plays, and anything that makes you feel) at the center of your being, then you can’t afford to sort out your love life, start to think of it as the finished product. You’ve got to pick at it, keep it alive and in turmoil, you’ve got to pick at it and unravel it until it all comes apart and you’re compelled to start all over again. Maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who absorb emotional things all day, and as a consequence we can never feel merely content: we have to be unhappy, or ecstatically, head-over-heels happy, and those states are difficult to achieve within a stable, solid relationship.
love one another, but make not a bond of love:  let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.  fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.  give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf  sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,  even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.
He who wants a rose must respect her thorn.
Love has no limitations. It cannot be measured. It has no boundaries. Although many have tried, love is indefinable.
Over time as most people fail the survivor's exacting test of trustworthiness, she tends to withdraw from relationships. The isolation of the survivor thus persists even after she is free.
Never judge someone by their relatives.
She is delightfully chaotic; a beautiful mess. Loving her is a splendid adventure.
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women love when they abandon their self-reliance. When a strong woman recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never any strength to throw away. One source of her inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion. She has never had practice in making the best of such a condition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new.
Time has its revenges, but revenge seems so often sour. Wouldn’t we all do better not trying to understand, accepting the fact that no human being will ever understand another, not a wife with a husband, nor a parent a child? Perhaps that’s why men have invented God – a being capable of understanding.
A friend is someone whose face you can see in the dark.
the wounded child inside many males is a boy who, when he first spoke his truths, was silenced by paternal sadism, by a patriarchal world that did not want him to claim his true feelings. The wounded child inside many females is a girl who was taught from early childhood that she must become something other than herself, deny her true feelings, in order to attract and please others. When men and women punish each other for truth telling, we reinforce the notion that lies are better. To be loving we willingly hear the other’s truth, and most important, we affirm the value of truth telling. Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love.
Theresa, I know there's a part of you that believes you can change someone, but the reality is that you can't. You can change yourself, and Garrett can change himself, but you can't do it for him.
Hide yourself in God, so when a man wants to find you he will have to go there first.
People generally didn't cheat in good relationships.
Most don't deserve your tears... and the ones that do will never make you cry.
Relationships are treated like Dixie cups. They are the same. They are disposable. If it does not work, drop it, throw it away, get another. Committed bonds (including marriage) cannot last when this is the prevailing logic. Most of us are unclear about what to do to protect and strengthen caring bonds when our self-centered needs are not being met.
I think when men hear that women want a commitment, they think it means commitment to a romantic relationship, but that's not it. It's a commitment to not floating around anywhere. I want a guy who is entrenched in his own life.
One minute of reconciliation is worth more than a whole life of friendship!
Why be alone when we can be together baby You can make my life worthwhile And I can make you start to smile
She was broken, I think it’s because she loved too much and she was always blind to the fact that love too is sometimes broken.
A broken heart is just the growing pains necessary so that you can love more completely when the real thing comes along.
How was I supposed to know what’s real and what’s not? It feels like I’m the only one who doesn’t know the difference.
I had a dream about you last night. The champagne was non-alcoholic. You didn't notice, and laughed at my jokes anyway.
My dad had limitations. That's what my good-hearted mom always told us. He had limitations, but he meant no harm. It was kind of her to say, but he did do harm.
I thought he should have realized sooner that important people don't show up very often, and you should hold on to them when they do. Maybe I was smarter than he was all along, because that was something I'd always known.
Daughter! Get you an honest Man for a Husband, and keep him honest. No matter whether he is rich, provided he be independent. Regard the Honour and moral Character of the Man more than all other Circumstances. Think of no other Greatness but that of the soul, no other Riches but those of the Heart. An honest, Sensible humane Man, above all the Littlenesses of Vanity, and Extravagances of Imagination, labouring to do good rather than be rich, to be usefull rather than make a show, living in a modest Simplicity clearly within his Means and free from Debts or Obligations, is really the most respectable Man in Society, makes himself and all about him the most happy.
I'm done. I don't need anything more out of life. I have you, and that's enough.
Don't answer the door in a wedding dress and veil, he might not think you're joking.
You think being dead inside is bad until someone brings you back to life and stabs you in the chest without the intention of killing you.
In the best, the friendliest and simplest relations flattery or praise is necessary, just as grease is necessary to keep wheels turning.
Madness and chaos are self-destructing but over thinking is the suicide.
I know I'm not going to be in your head all the time. But once you know me, I'll be forever in your heart. 
Delusion detests focus and romance provides the veil.
To us, your power comes from one simple thing: you’re a woman, and we men will do anything humanly possible to impress you so that, ultimately, we can be with you. You’re the driving force behind why we wake up every day. Men go out and get jobs and hustle to make money because of women. We drive fancy cars because of women. We dress nice, put on cologne, get haircuts and try to look all shiny and new for you. We do all of this because the more our game is stepped up, the more of you we get. You’re the ultimate prize to us.
To be deeply loved, means a willingness to cut yourself wide open, exposing your vulnerabilities... hopes, hurts, fears and flaws. Hiding behind the highlight reel of who you are, is the real you and that person is just as worthy of love. There is nothing more terrifying or fulfilling, than complete love, it's worth the risk... reach for it.
Trust and faith bring joy to life and help relationships grow to their maximum potential.
Be a bit of a challenge; not because you're playing games but because you realize you're worth the extra effort.
I will never deny that life isn't fair. It seems as though when a woman leaves a man she is strong and independent, but when a man leaves a woman he is a pig and a jerk.
I had a dream about you last night.. you were holding a pine cone and introducing him as Gerald.
So I learned two things that night, and the next day, from him: the perfection of a moment, and the fleeting nature of it.
My wife and I just don't have the same feelings for each other we used to have. I guess I just don't love her anymore and she doesn't love me. What can i do?" "The feeling isn't there anymore?" I asked. "That's right," he reaffirmed. "And we have three children we're really concerned about. What do you suggest?" "love her," I replied. "I told you, the feeling just isn't there anymore." "Love her." "You don't understand. the feeling of love just isn't there." "Then love her. If the feeling isn't there, that's a good reason to love her." "But how do you love when you don't love?"  "My friend , love is a verb. Love - the feeling - is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?
You get lonely, is what it is. A person's not supposed to go through life with absolutely nobody. It's not normal. The longer you go by yourself the weirder you get, and the weirder you get the longer you go by yourself. It's a loop and you gotta do something to get out of it.
Truth builds trust.
Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse's perspective. We must first learn what is important to our spouse. Only then can we give encouragement. With verbal encouragement, we are trying to communicate, "I know. I care. I am with you. How can I help?" We are trying to show that we believe in him and in his abilities. We are giving credit and praise.
I used to loathe ambivalence; now I adore it. Ambivalence is my new best friend.
Never knew what a friendship was, Never knew how to really love, You can't be what I need you to, &amp; I don't know why I fuck with you
If I lived a million lives, I would've felt a million feelings and I still would've fallen a million times for you.
It’s funny, for all it took was a broken heart and that alone was enough, enough for her to do everything she ever dreamed of.
Society will always be too fragile to accept us for all that makes us beautiful.
The strength of a man isn't seen in the power of his arms. It's seen in the love with which he EMBRACES you.
Somewhere between love and hate lies confusion, misunderstanding and desperate hope.
The truth is I didn’t need therapy; I just needed to feel loved and know that someone out there craved my attention.
Appreciate the moment of a first kiss; it may be the last time you own your heart.
In any relationship in which two people become one, the end result is two half people.
There is no mystery-- that's the beauty of it. We are entirely explicable to each other, and yet we stay. What a miracle that is.
You didn't just cheat on me; you cheated on us. You didn't just break my heart; you broke our future.
One thing I've learned is it's better to be addicted to things than people. You get hooked on a <i>thing</i> and if someone takes it from you, you can find another source. Only people can really hurt you. Only people can push you out into the cold permanently.
I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, it’ll make sense.
We've lost a lot of years, but you can't lose love. Not real love. It stays locked inside you, ready for whenever you are strong enough to find it again.
Relationships never provide you with everything. They provide you with some things. You take all the things you want from a person -- sexual chemistry, let's say, or good conversation, or financial support, or intellectual compatibility, or niceness, or loyalty -- and you get to pick three of those things. The rest you have to look for elsewhere. It's only in the movies that you find someone who gives you all those things. But this isn't the movies. In the real world, you have to identify which three qualities you want to spend the rest of your life with, and then you look for those qualities in another person. That's real life. Don't you see it's a trap? If you keep trying to find everything, you'll wind up with nothing.
With each reunion (we) had to learn each other all over again. There was always that nervous moment at the airport when I would stand there waiting for him to arrive, wondering, Will I still know him? Will he still know me?
I had to learn to live without you and I couldn't make sense of it, because I left so much of me inside of you.
Regrets came up and asked me if I’d like to own them. Declined them for the most part but took a few just so I wouldn’t leave this relationship empty handed.
Relationships are never about power, and one way to avoid the will to power is to choose to limit oneself- to serve.
To be honest, it was pretty hard to leave. I desperately wanted to turn around, and tell him everything would be okay. That I adore him and I trust him and that I'll stand by him while he goes through this tough time. But I'm just too tired. I'm thirty years old. I'm tired of relationships that are always painful. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of waiting by the phone, and second-guessing what a guy says and trusting someone not to hurt me. Again. I've been storming the relationship castle for fifteen years, and I still don't have my prince. I've got a bunch of battle scars from the field and I want to go home and nurse my wounds. I don't want to fight anymore.
After their encounter on the approach to Jupiter, there would aways be a secret bond between them---not of love, but of tenderness, which is often more enduring.
You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water...
A relationship isn't something that has to be created in a day or perfected in a day. Part of the game is to keep working on it. It's something that'll always be just a little flawed.
Over time, any deception destroys intimacy, and without intimacy couples cannot have true and lasting love.
Men are jealous of every woman, even when they don’t have the slightest interest in her themselves.
I think of how each person in a marriage owes it to the other to find individual happiness, even in a shared life. That this is the only way to grow together, instead of apart.
I'm tired of waiting by the phone, and second-guessing what a guy says and trusting someone not to hurt me. Again. I've been storming the relationship castle for fifteen years, and I still don't have my prince. I've got a bunch of battle scars from the field and I want to go home and nurse my wounds. I don't want to fight anymore.
Love is giving up control. It’s surrendering the desire to control the other person. The two—love and controlling power over the other person—are mutually exclusive. If we are serious about loving someone, we have to surrender all the desires within us to manipulate the relationship.
I hate the way, once you start to know someone, care about them, their behavior can distress you, even when it's unreasonable and not your fault, even if you were really trying to be careful, tactful.
I need to figure out the secret. I need to work out how to keep things flying back to me instead of always flying away.
Jesus waited three days to come back to life. It was perfect! If he had only waited one day, a lot of people wouldn't have even heard he died. They'd be all, "Hey Jesus, what up?" and Jesus would probably be like, "What up? I died yesterday!" and they'd be all, "Uh, you look pretty alive to me, dude..." and then Jesus would have to explain how he was resurrected, and how it was a miracle, and the dude'd be like "Uhh okay, whatever you say, bro..." And he's not gonna come back on a Saturday. Everybody's busy, doing chores, workin' the loom, trimmin' the beard, NO. He waited the perfect number of days, three. Plus it's Sunday, so everyone's in church already, and they're all in there like "Oh no, Jesus is dead", and then BAM! He bursts in the back door, runnin' up the aisle, everyone's totally psyched, and FYI, that's when he invented the high five. That's why we wait three days to call a woman, because that's how long Jesus wants us to wait.... True story.
But I think we both knew, even then, that what we had was something even more rare, and even more meaningful. I was going to be his friend, and was going to show him possibilities. And he, in turn, would become someone I could trust more than myself.
Some of the biggest challenges in relationships come from the fact that most people enter a relationship in order to get something: they're trying to find someone who's going to make them feel good. In reality, the only way a relationship will last is if you see your relationship as a place that you go to give, and not a place that you go to take.
Annabeth realized that if six of them went on these two quests, it would leave Percy alone on the ship with Coach Hedge, which was maybe not a situation a caring girlfriend should put him in. Nor was she eager to let Percy out of her sight again—not after they’d been apart for so many months.
Basically, all women are nurturers and healers, and all men are mental patients to varying degrees.
If there is one thing I can pass on from my humbling experiences in life, thus far, I will tell you this, the next time someone tells you "the absence of expectations is the absence of disappointment, do not listen. Have expectations. Keep them great. It'll be a very bumpy ride. You'll even get bruised, sometimes very badly. Sometimes, you'll come to an abrupt halt or even fall off your ride. But you'll grow. And if you do not grow, you do not live.
Suddenly, everything was beautiful. The way she viewed the world was nothing more but a reflection of herself.
But what are loyalty and caring really worth?" "To me? Everything.
There's never a reason to trust someone. If there's a reason, then it's not trust.
What if we just acknowledged that we have a bad relationship, and we stuck it out, anyway? What if we admitted that we make each other nuts, we fight constantly and hardly ever have sex, but we can't live without each other, so we deal with it? And then we could spend our lives together -- in misery, but happy to not be apart.
Nothing is stranger or more ticklish than a relationship between people who know each other only by sight, who meet and observe each other daily - no hourly - and are nevertheless compelled to keep up the pose of an indifferent stranger, neither greeting nor addressing each other, whether out of etiquette or their own whim.
Asking for help with shame says:  <i>You have the power over me.</i> Asking with condescension says:  <i>I have the power over you.</i> But asking for help with gratitude says: <i>We have the power to help each other.</i>
She was still under the spell of her infatuation. She had tried to forget him, realizing the inutility of remembering. But the thought of him was like an obsession, ever pressing itself upon her. It was not that she dwelt upon details of their acquaintance, or recalled in any special or peculiar way his personality; it was his being, his existence, which dominated her thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the mist of the forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled her with an incomprehensible longing.
To be human is to be broken and broken is its own kind of beautiful.
You don't stop loving someone just because you hate them.
It's better to have a few faithful friends than numerous shallow friendships.
There was no one to be seen so she gave in freely to her sobs as she made her way home, pressed her arms against her stomach; the pain lodged in there like an ill-tempered foetus. <i>Let a person in and he hurts you.</i>  There was a reason why she kept her relationships brief. Don't let them in. Once they're inside they have more potential to hurt you. Comfort yourself. You can live with the anguish as long as it only involves yourself. As long as there is no hope.
She was broken from moment to moment, watching her world collide she felt lost inside herself. She fell apart for a passion that flamed beneath her. She waited and died a hundred times, it dripped from her pores. The moment she let go, she soared over the stillness like the star she was born to be.
Ask yourself, does this person make me feel good about myself? Do I feel safe, strong and free with this person? Those are the questions you need to ask....You have to be strong to truly be open.
Sometimes you get everything you ever wanted, only it doesn't look like what you wanted anymore.
To love everyone unconditionally does not mean to give everyone your unconditional time. Sometimes, to love completely, we must never see someone again. This, too, is love. This is giving someone the freedom to exist and be happy, even if it must be without you.
When we love someone our love becomes demonstrable or real only through our exertion - through the fact that for that someone (or for ourself) we take an extra step or walk an extra mile. Love is not effortless. To the contrary, love is effortful.
I had a dream about you. I was sitting on your couch, relating my succession of ideas on subconscious influence. I asked you what they meant, and you told me that free associations were a bad way to advance my political career.
So that’s how we live our lives. No matter how deep and fatal the loss, no matter how important the thing that's stolen from us - that's snatched right out of our hands - even if we are left completely changed, with only the outer layer of skin from before, we continue to play out our lives this way, in silence. We draw ever nearer to the end of our allotted span of time, bidding it farewell as it trails off behind. Repeating, often adroitly, the endless deeds of the everyday.  Leaving behind a feeling of insurmountable emptiness... Maybe, in some distant place, everything is already, quietly, lost. Or at least there exists a silent place where everything can disappear, melting together in a single, overlapping figure. And as we live our lives we discover - drawing toward us the thin threads attached to each - what has been lost. I closed my eyes and tried to bring to mind as many beautiful lost things as I could. Drawing them closer, holding on to them. Knowing all the while that their lives are fleeting.
Was it necessary to tell me that you wanted nothing in the world but me?'  The corners of his mouth drooped peevishly.  Oh, my dear, it's rather hard to take quite literally the things a man says when he's in love with you.'  Didn't you mean them?'  At the moment.
If you have feelings for someone, let them know. It doesn’t matter if they can be in your life or not. Maybe, it is just enough for both of you to release the truth, so healing can occur. The opposite is true, as well. If you don’t have feelings for someone then never let another person suggest that you do. Protect your reputation and be responsible for the wrong information spread about you. Never allow anyone to live with a false belief or unfounded hope about you. An honorable person sets the record straight, so that person can move on with their life.
What is it about men that make women so lonely?
Women writers make for rewarding (and efficient) lovers. They are clever liars to fathers and husbands; yet they never hold their tongues too long, nor keep ardent typing fingers still.
Truth is, something that I thought was perfect was taken away from me, and I never wanted perfect again. I wanted middle of the road, stuff I didn’t care about so that I couldn’t lose anything I really loved ever again.
What marriage offers - and what fidelity is meant to protect - is the possibility of moments when what we have chosen and what we desire are the same. Such a convergence obviously cannot be continuous. No relationship can continue very long at its highest emotional pitch. But fidelity prepares us for the return of these moments, which give us the highest joy we can know; that of union, communion, atonement (in the root sense of at-one-ment)... To forsake all others does not mean - because it cannot mean - to ignore or neglect all others, to hide or be hidden from all others, or to desire or love no others. To live in marriage is a responsible way to live in sexuality, as to live in a household is a responsible way to live in the world. One cannot enact or fulfill one's love for womankind or mankind, or even for all the women or men to whom one is attracted. If one is to have the power and delight of one's sexuality, then the generality of instinct must be resolved in a responsible relationship to a particular person. Similarly, one cannot live in the world; that is, one cannot become, in the easy, generalizing sense with which the phrase is commonly used, a "world citizen." There can be no such think as a "global village." No matter how much one may love the world as a whole, one can live fully in it only by living responsibly in some small part of it. Where we live and who we live there with define the terms of our relationship to the world and to humanity. We thus come again to the paradox that one can become whole only by the responsible acceptance of one's partiality. (pg.117-118, "The Body and the Earth")
To respect the dignity of a relationship also implies accepting the end when it comes. Except in my mind, except in my dreams, where the aftertaste of her still lingers.
Everything you want in life is a relationship away.
It was never about the world being too big, it was more like she was too much for the world to handle.
Maybe I hope too much. Maybe I dream too much or maybe I love too much to just give up on you.
I had a dream about you last night... you were a giant slinky and I watched you fall down the stairs.
They had, finally, the only thing anyone really wants in life: someone to hold your hand when you die.
Love doesn't come with an on-off switch. It's made of too many threads of memory and hope and heartache that weave themselves into the very core of who you are.
Eve: “If you ended up naked and dead with another woman, I'd do the Rumba on your corpse.” Roarke: “You can't do the Rumba.” Eve: “I'd take lessons first.”  Roarke: “You might very well. Not that you'll ever get the chance, but you'd also grieve.”  Eve: “Wouldn't give you the satisfaction. You cheating f-wit putz. "  Roarke: “You'd weep in the dark and call my name.” Eve: “Call your name alright. How are things in hell? You dickless bastard. And I'd laugh and laugh, that's how I''d call your name.” Roarke: “Christ Jesus Eve, I love you.”  --Eve, Roarke
The bank of love is never bankrupt.
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
Roen snorted. "You two have the strangest relationship in the Dells."  Archer smiled slightly. "She won't consent to make it a marriage."  "I can't imagine what's stopping her. I don't suppose you've considered being less munificent with your love?"  "Would you marry me, Fire, if I slept in no one's bed but yours?"  He knew the answer to that, but it didn't hurt to remind him. "No, and I should find my bed quite cramped.
We are the sum of all people we have ever met; you change the tribe and the tribe changes you.
Some of the most beautiful things we have in life comes from our mistakes.
Dominator culture teaches all of us that the core of our identity is defined by the will to dominate and control others. We are taught that this will to dominate is more biologically hardwired in males than in females. In actuality, dominator culture teaches us that we are all natural-born killers but that males are more able to realize the predator role. In the dominator model the pursuit of external power, the ability to manipulate and control others, is what matters most. When culture is based on a dominator model, not only will it be violent but it will frame all relationships as power struggles.
I look back to where my life had been. It's always risky to think of letting go. That's why this is the perfect ending. Nothing left to reconcile.
He carries stars in his pockets because he knows she fears the dark. Whenever sadness pays her a visit he paints galaxies on the back of her hands.
I had a dream about you last night. I was alone on a dark night and you came to me as a firefly. I knew it was you because you were the brightest.
A soul mate is not found. A soul mate is recognized.
Some people don’t realize what they have until it’s gone, but that does not always mean they are supposed to get it back.
Oh, he did look like a deity – the perfect balance of danger and charm, he was at the same time fascinating and inaccessible, distant because of his demonstrated flawlessness, and possessing such strength of character that he was dismaying and at the same time utterly attractive in an enticing and forbidden way.
With the cure, relationships are all the same, and rules and expectations are defined. Without the cure, relationships must be reinvented every day, languages constantly decoded and deciphered. Freedom is exhausting.
I had a dream about you. You were lost in a daydream, when I walked in and you began screaming. But I know that could never actually happen. In real life I only enter people’s nightmares.
A beautiful thing happens when we start paying attention to each other. It is by participating more in your relationship that you breathe life into it.
I've heard that people stand in bad situations because a relationship like that gets turned up by degrees. It is said that a frog will jump out of a pot of boiling water. Place him in a pot and turn it up a little at a time, and he will stay until he is boiled to death. Us frogs understand this.
Sometimes not talking is effortless, and other times it’s more exhausting than lifting pianos.
I don't deserve you. I'm not made for relationships. I know I'm going to fuck this up. I'm going to drive you away or do something to hurt you, and you'll be added to my list of people I screwed over. You should walk away now.
He feared me as many men fear women: because their mistresses (or their wives) understand them. They are scarcely adult, some men: they wish women to understand them, and to that end they tell them all their secrets; and then, when they are properly understood, they hate their women for understanding them.
You don't fix a man the way you do a fault in a pipe or a leak in a roof. You take him as he is, Mary Brenna, or you don't take him at all...adjustments can't be all made on one side, darling, else the balance goes off and what's being built just falls down.
I pictured Cupid sitting in a crappy little bar, drunk and depressed, while he moaned to the bartender, "That Jasmine Parks, <i>gods</i>, she pisses me off! Did you see what she just did? Totally blew off this immortal stud to play kiss-the-boo-boo with a fickle little rent-a-cop. Why? 'Cause she's the biggest chickenshit on the planet! I'm ready to toss my bow and pick up a bazooka!
I was trying to decide if you still had free will as a wolf. If I was a terrible person for planning to drug my girlfriend and drag her back to my house to keep in the basement.
She never got a chance to fall out of love, to do it properly, slowly and thoroughly, and the result was he was like a phantom limb. Gone but still there. And like a true phantom limb, the preponderance of feelings associated with him were painful.
She knew that what she was going through was nothing special, just garden-variety heartbreak, the sort of thing that poets and novelists had been writing about for hundreds of years, but she also knew, from those same books, that there were people who never recover form it, ones who go on through life beset by a dim and painful longing.
So many events and moments that seemed insignificant add up. I remember how for the last Valentine´s Day, N gave flowers but no card. In restaurants, he looked off into the middle distance while my hand would creep across the table to hold his. He would always let go first. I realize I can´t remember his last spontaneous gesture of affection.
Pundits are always blaming TV for making people stupid, movies for desensitizing the world to violence, and rock music for making kids take drugs and kill themselves. These things should be the least of our worries. The main problem with mass media is that it makes it impossible to fall in love with any acumen of normalcy. There is no 'normal,' because everybody is being twisted by the same sources simultaneously.
..I find it incredible impossible not to cry when I hear Stevie Nicks's "Landslide," especially the lyric: "I've been afraid of changing, because I've built my life around you." I think a good test to see if a human is actually a robot/android/cylon is to have them listen to this song lyric and study their reaction. If they don't cry, you should stab them through the heart. You will find a fusebox.
We kissed each other until we were too tired to keep going. I could still feel him holding back. It was my penance for what I had done to him. All I could do was hope the walls would fall and that I could have all of him again, but I was always leaving and he was tired of watching me walk away. We both knew that I couldn’t stay and that he couldn’t come with me, but still, we couldn’t let go.
All's fair in love and war," said Ron brightly, "and this is a bit of both.
Trying to fall out of love is like trying to climb a mountain. Blindfolded, on crutches, naked in a hail storm.
You cold or something?' he said. She strained against him; she wanted to pass clear through him: 'It's a chill, it's nothing'; and then, pushing a little away: 'Say you love me.'  I said it.'  No, oh no. You haven't. I was listening. And you never do.'  Well, give me time.'  Please.'  He sat up and glanced at a clock across the room. It was after five. Then decisively he pulled off his windbreaker and began to unlace his shoes.  Aren't you going to, Clyde?'  He grinned back at her. 'Yeah, I'm going to.'  I don't mean that; and what's more, I don't like it: you sound as though you were talking to a whore.'  Come off it, honey. You didn't drag me up here to tell you about love.'  You disgust me,' she said.  Listen to her! She's sore!'  A silence followed that circulated like an aggrieved bird. Clyde said, 'You want to hit me, huh? I kind of like you when you're sore: that's the kind of girl you are,' which made Grady light in his arms when he lifted and kissed her. 'You still want me to say it?' Her head slumped on his shoulder. 'Because I will,' he said, fooling his fingers in her hair. 'Take off your clothes--and I'll tell it to you good.
[Marriage] happens as with cages: the birds without despair to get in, and those within despair of getting out.
I never tell my boyfriend that I'm busy when I'm not. No matter how effective they are, cheap techniques like that just don't agree with me. So it's always okay, it's always all right. In my opinion the surest way to hook a man is to be as open with him as possible.
Prince or commoner, tenor or bass, Painter or plumber or never-do-well, Do me a favor and shut your face - Poets alone should kiss and tell.
Women and men who have established no-lie relationships talk about them with reverence, even when they are not permanent and, in fact, even when they are not romantic. Why? In the no-lie relationship there is acceptance of who each partner is, rather than a shallow idealization. There is a genuine commitment to the relationship beyond the immediate. You each act as though you are in a real partnership that will last.
...he prayed fundamentally as a gesture of love for what had gone and would go and could be loved in no other way. When he prayed he touched his parents, who could not otherwise be touched, and he touched a feeling that we are all children who lose our parents, all of us, every man and woman and boy and girl, and we too will all be lost by those who come after us and love us, and this loss unites humanity, unites every human being, the temporary nature of our being-ness, and our shared sorrow, the heartache we each carry and yet too often refuse to acknowledge in one another, and out of this Saeed felt it might be possible, in the face of death, to believe in humanity's potential for building a better world, so he prayed as a lament, as a consolation, and as a hope....
You’re not a bad person, you’re just a little bit different and I’m a sucker for that.
Maybe love was meant to save us from ourselves.
You can argue that it's a different world now than the one when Matthew Shepard was killed, but there is a subtle difference between tolerance and acceptance. It's the distance between moving into the cul-de-sac and having your next door neighbor trust you to keep an eye on her preschool daughter for a few minutes while she runs out to the post office. It's the chasm between being invited to a colleague's wedding with your same-sex partner and being able to slow-dance without the other guests whispering.
She wildly burned for the one she loved and he stood there watching, hoping he too would catch a blaze from the violence stirring in her heart.
Love falls in love with love;  comes like an echo sounding back,  searches its mirrored shadow  within a look.
I had a dream about you last night. I could fly. I was going to use this power to impress you, but you were too heavy to carry, so I won you over with my personality instead
It's always hard to remember love - years pass and you say to yourself, Was I really in love, or was I just kidding myself? Was I really in love, or was I just pretending he was the man of my dreams? Was I really in love, or was I just desperate?
I had a dream about you last night. The best day of my life was when I taught you how to juggle, but the best day of yours was when you taught someone else.
He thought about this for a second. "True. But if you never really make friends, you probably don't have anyone to be your 2 a.m. Which would kind of suck.  I just looked at him as he stirred his soup, carrots spinning in the liquid. "Your what?"  "Two a.m." He swallowed, then said, "You know. The person you can call at two a.m. and, no matter what, you can count on them. Even if they're asleep or it's cold or you need to be bailed out of jail...they'll come for you. It's, like, the highest level of friendship.
How dare you say it's nothing to me? Baby, you're the only light I ever saw.
Solid character will reflect itself in consistent behavior, while poor character will seek to hide behind deceptive words and actions.
The girl was grateful to the young man for every bit of flattery; she wanted to linger for a moment in its warmth and so she said, 'You're very good at lying.'  'Do I look like a liar?'  'You look like you enjoy lying to women,' said the girl, and into her words there crept unawares a touch of the old anxiety, because she really did believe that her young man enjoyed lying to women.
I can see that the sadness has returned. And it's not a beautiful sadness- beautiful sadness is a myth. Sadness turns our features to clay, not porcelain.
We are one of those couples i used to watch, thinking to myself that I'd never be on the inside of something so special. I remember reassuring myself that it probably looked nicer than it actually was, I am happy to be wrong about that.
In your pursuit of your passions, always be young. In your relationship with others, always be grown-up.
He is your friend who pushes you nearer to God.
It was completely fifth garde and completely silly and I loved it, because he wasn't afraid to be silly. It was like kissing him first - I could do whatever I wanted and not have to worry what he'd think of me.
If we are to feel the positive feelings of love, happiness, trust, and gratitude, we periodically also have to feel anger, sadness, fear, and sorrow.
Every broken heart has screamed at one time or another: Why can't you see who I truly am?
Love is something you do for someone else, not something you do for yourself.
I have never bought into the idea that blood is thicker than water. Love and respect are meant to be earned from our children, our spouses, our families, and our friends.
A family can be the bane of one's existence. A family can also be most of the meaning of one's existence. I don't know whether my family is bane or meaning, but they have surely gone away and left a large hole in my heart.
Everyday it gets easier to connect with an electronic device that it is to connect with real people.
If it comes, let it come. If it goes, it's ok, let it go. Let things come and go. Stay calm, don't let anything disturb your peace, and carry on.
I Love Loving You  You are my favorite song; a rhythm of beauty that captures my spirit.  You are my favorite poem; an exquisite grouping of ideas set in motion with an unmatched enchanting elegance.   You are my best friend; from our laughter to our deep conversations, our moments together are a timeless pleasure.  You are my soul mate; a connection so pure, so powerful, that it can only be considered divine.   You are my lover; a passionate entwinement, a chorus of ecstasy, and a feeling of complete unity that words could never adequately describe.  You are my angel; you remind me of the goodness in this world and inspire me to be the greatest version of myself.  You are my home; it is in your loving gaze that I find the comfort, acceptance, and the sense of belonging.   You are my love ~ mi amor; there are not enough days in forever to allow me to fully express my love for you.  I love loving you.
Playing the victim role: Manipulator portrays him- or herself as a victim of circumstance or of someone else's behavior in order to gain pity, sympathy or evoke compassion and thereby get something from another. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation.
Love grows from stable relationships, shared experience, loyalty, devotion, trust.
Ask anyone and they'll most likely say their family is crazy, and if they don't say their family is crazy, their friends are crazy. That's because everyone is crazy after taking the mask off. People are most themselves when not really trying to fit in, when either alone or around those already closest to them, and that is crazy.
Just because a relationship ends, it doesn't mean it's not worth having.
My heart is burning a hole in my chest and every time you speak to me, it keeps sinking, and I'm left with nothing but ashes. I wish she were talking to me, because the more she speaks to me, the more my heart flutters like a rising phoenix. -Karen Quan and Jarod Kintz
I need you because I know I deserve you but let me fall in love with you one last time before I let go. So I can remember the beautiful imperfection that rattled my bones.
Love spiritually, not strategically.
It's unexpectedly painful to have become a pronoun.
Friendships are nice. So is competence.
And the terrible thing, the terrible thing is, but the good thing too, the saving grace, is that if something happened to one of us--excuse me for saying this--but if something happened to one of us tomorrow, I think the other one, the other person, would grieve for a while, you know, but then the surviving party would go out and love again, have someone else soon enough. All this, all of this love we're talking about, it would just be a memory. Maybe not even a memory.
I had a dream about you last night. We watched pornography together, but purely for the storyline.
I had a dream about you last night.. You were playing with chicken livers and told me everyone was in quarantine.
I had a dream about you last night.. you were trying to give coordinates to an apple
He doesn’t have to love your CD collection. He doesn’t have to love your shoes. But any good, mature guy better make an attempt to love your friends and family—especially when they’re great.
There’s nothing like that feeling of waiting for a guy. It’s the loneliest feeling in the world. Holding that cell phone in your hand as you take out the trash, use the bathroom, change the litter box. Fearful that the one second you aren’t looking will be when they call. Pathetic. And something I have done as recently as last week.
But dear, don’t be afraid of love it’s only magic.
Your first impulse is to share good news, your second is to club someone with it.
Do not hold your breath for anyone, Do not wish your lungs to be still, It may delay the cracks from spreading, But eventually they will. Sometimes to keep yourself together You must allow yourself to leave, Even if breaking your own heart Is what it takes to let you breathe.
Oh for God's sake,' Heather said, 'I wish you two would just go out, fail miserably as a couple, and get it over with.
When she was younger, she felt that he wanted to know everything about her, but she was sometimes afraid to tell too much. She was afraid he would know her too well, that he would find some weakness in her, some element that would turn him away, maybe even a quality she didn't even realize she possessed.
Needy people are like newborns, I have come to realize. One intoxicated night and BAM! You are stuck with this problem. You finally take it home and it wants to keep you up all night and cries when it isn’t sucking on various parts of your anatomy. It wants you there for everything – rocking, feeding, burping, changing... It’s ridiculous. If I wanted a kid I would have one. Until then, grow the hell up and stand on your own two feet, you little crazy.
That guys. Sideburns. You like him?" My back squirms. "You've asked me that before." "What I meant was," he says, flustered. "Your feelings haven't changed? Since you've been here?" It takes a moment to consider the question. "It's not a matter of how <i>I</i> feel," I say at last. "I'm interested, but ... I don't know if he's still interested in me." St. Clair edges closer. "Does he still call?" "Yeah. I mean, not often. But yes." "Right. Right, well," he says, blinking. "There's your answer.
Because he could not afford to fail, he could not afford to trust.
Women that can work a camera with ease often work men just as effortlessly for both require the same commitment to vanity and manipulation.
A man can know his father, or his son, and there might still be nothing between them but loyalty and love and mutual incomprehension.
Give a man a centimeter and he'll think he's a ruler.
We had been friends. We could not become strangers. It left only one thing: we must be enemies.
It's easy to like someone from a distance. But when she stopped being this amazing unattainable thing or whatever, and started being, like, just a regular girl with a weird relationship with food and frequent crankiness wh's kind of bossy--then I had to basically start liking a whole different person.
Everyone creates realities based on their own personal beliefs. These beliefs are so powerful that they can create [expansive or entrapping] realities over and over.~Kuan Yin
THE WEATHER OF LOVE   Love Has a way of wilting Or blossoming At the strangest, Most unpredictable hour. This is how love is, An uncontrollable beast In the form of a flower. The sun does not always shine on it. Nor does the rain always pour on it Nor should it always get beaten by a storm. Love does not always emit the sweetest scents, And sometimes it can sting with its thorns. Water it. Give it plenty of sunlight. Nurture it, And the flower of love will Outlive you. Neglect it or keep dissecting it, And its petals will quickly curl up and die. This is how love is, Perfection is a delusional vision. So love the person who loves you Unconditionally, And abandon the one Who only loves you Under favorable Conditions.
You're walking funny," Lucy said, a shit-eating grin on her face. Five days of out of this world sex with a starving man could do that to a girl.  "You're just jealous." Brenna pushed through the door into DarkRiver's business HQ.  Lucy made a mournful face. "Yes, I am. Goddamn but your man is hot. And he smiles at you! I've seen him do it, even if no one believes me.
Love doesn't erase the past, but it makes the future different.
Winter is much like unrequited love; cold and merciless.
There is no formula to relationships. They have to be negotiated in loving ways, with room for both parties, what they want and what they need, what they can do and what their life is like. In business, people negotiate to win. They negotiate to get what they want. Maybe you’re too used to that. Love is different. Love is when you are as concerned about someone else’s situation as you are about your own.
This is new to us, you know? Your mother's sorry. She's sorry that she hurt your feelings, and she wants you to invite your girlfriend over for dinner." "So that she can make her feel bad and weird?" "Well she is kind of weird, isn't she?" Park didn't have the energy to be angry. He sighed and let his head fall back on the chair.  His dad kept talking. "Isn't that why you like her?
You’re a mess, I confess, I despise you in the best kind of way.
You know your problem, Quentin? You keep expecting people not to be themselves.
Relationship gurus always said that an attraction based on friendship and mutual respect was far more likely to stay the course - and the bastards were right.
Tanith frowned. Did people still go on DATES any more? She was sure they did. They probably called it something different though. She tried to think of the last date she'd been on. The last PROPER date. Did fighting side by side with Saracen Rue count as a date? They ended up snuggling under the moonlight, drenched in gore and pieces of brain - so it had PROBABLY been a date. If it wasn't, it was certainly a fun time had by all. Well, not ALL. But she and Saracen had sure had a blast.
we are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our body, which is doomed to decay..., from the external world which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless force of destruction, and finally from our relations with other men... This last source is perhaps more painful to use than any other. (p77)
But the coconut is also a symbol of resilience, Samar. Even in the conditions where there's very little nourishment and even less nurturance, it flourishes, growing taller than most of the plants around it.
Despite the fact that I have no regrets about how things turned out in my life, I still can't help wanting to understand my intense relationship with Leo, as well as that turbulent time between adolescence and adulthood when everything feels raw and invigorating and scary-and why those feelings are all coming back to me now.
Why?' He asked. 'Why what?' What could I say? Noah, despite you being an asshole, or maybe because of it, I'd like to rip off your clothes and have your babies. Don't tell.
Don't let a thief into your house three times. The first time was enough. The second time was a chance. The third time means you're stupid.
Because you let our love just fall apart You no longer have my heart
We look down our noses at people who've made mistakes in relationships. She's so stupid! How could she do that! Our superiority makes us feel better. But I’d bet everything I have on the fact that people to claim to have a perfect record in love are either lying or have very limited dating experience. People who say, I’d never do that! Someday, unless you are very, very lucky, you’ll have a story to tell. Or not to tell.
Those who take lightly promises they make to those they love are people who find little lasting satisfaction in life. This is not an easy time in which to live. That does not mean that it has to be a difficult time to love, but it does mean that you will find unusual stresses upon your lives and your relationship.
All of them, all except Phineas, constructed at infinite cost to themselves these Maginot Lines against this enemy they thought they saw across the frontier, this enemy who never attacked that way-if he ever attacked at all; if he was indeed the enemy.
Most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do; they think other people's opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval.
On the left side of a strong woman, stands a strong man; he is strengthened by her character.
It is not lies or a lack of loyalty that ends a relationship. It is the agonizing truth that one person feels in their heart on a daily basis. It is realizing that you are coping and not living. It is the false belief that there is a verse, quote, phrase or talk that will magically make you feel content, complete or not care. However, it doesn’t last longer than a few days, before your mind and heart goes back to what it wants. It is the moment you realize that you left without ever leaving. It is the moment you realize that fear, shame or guilt is the only thing standing in the way of the life God meant for you to live.
Please don’t hate you??!! I hate that I love you. Loving you made me waste a year of my life. Loving you made me be passionate about nothing but you. Loving you made me take risks I never would have otherwise. Loving you made me give it up to you. Loving you made me neglect my parents and Amy. Loving you made me not care that my grandma just died. Loving you made me turn out bitter and hopeless like her. Loving you made me hate myself for being dumped by you. Loving you made me deluded, irrational, inconsiderate, and a liar. And because I love you, you’re always going to haunt me.
Scholars, theologians, and even poets have yet to be able to truly describe and touch upon the beauty, romance, and magic of a relationship built on 100% authenticity
Someday I will have revenge. I know in advance to keep this to myself, and everyone will be happier. I do understand that I am expected to forgive N and his girlfriend in a timely fashion, and move on to a life of vegetarian cooking and difficult yoga positions and self-realization, and make this so much easier and more pleasant for all concerned.
Hearts set about finding other hearts the moment they are born, and between them, they weave nets so frightfully strong and tight that you end up bound forever in hopeless knots, even to the shadow of a beast you knew and loved long ago.
The snag about marriage is, it isn´t worth the divorce.
They (penguins) then fall madly in love and live happily ever after. - And so you ask yourself: "If a penguin can have a worthwhile, stimulating relationship, why the hell can't I?" - Or maybe you ask yourself: "Would I be happier if I started dating a penguin
Surprises, I feel now, are primarily a form of violence.
Love me like a wrong turn on a bad road late at night.
I love you as the mother of my child": the kiss of death. Mother of His Child: demotion. I am beginning to see this truism: Mothers are not always wives. I have been stripped of a piece of self.
Often we take personally the slings and arrows of our 'abusers'. But frequently we are merely the interchangeable pawns of their own neurotic dramas. Anyone else in your position would have received the same treatment. There is nothing especially noxious or negatively noteworthy about you.
When you've been around as long as me, Lucy, you'll know that there are three types of sex... One - brand-new, kitchen-table sex. Two - bedroom sex. Then number three - hallway sex, when you pass each other in the hallway and say 'Fuck you.'" - Lockie
I think we go well together. I like being with you because I'm never bored. Even when we're not talking, even when we're not touching, even when we're not in the same room, I'm not bored. I'm never bored. I think it's because I have confidence in you, in your thoughts. Do you understand? I love everything I see in you, and everything I don't see. I know your faults, but as it turns out, I feel as though your faults go well with my qualities. We're not afraid of the same things. Even our inner demons go well together! You, you're worth more than you show...
Someone asked me about the difference between love and lust. Hmmm. That will take a little thought. How to tell the difference? Well, for guys, if she looks better AFTER you've made love to her than before, that might be love. If you find yourself itching to get out the door afterward, probably just lust, y'know?
A good place to meet a man is at the dry cleaner. These men usually have jobs and bathe.
Death ends a life, not a relationship.
I will never claim to know what you are thinking. I only hope I am on your mind.
We do not have to be mental health professionals to identify the traits of the possible sociopaths among us.
Family, friends and relationships are the blessings of the God. They are the best way to access God.
There is nothing more beautiful than a vulnerable heart in open hands.
Do you know how it hurts to touch you knowing that in the morning I’ll still wake up alone?
Evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of any relationship is your responsibility. You do not have to passively accept what is brought to you. You can choose.
That’s always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people would want to be around someone because they’re pretty. It’s like picking your breakfast cereals based on color instead of taste.
One of the most important of life´s lessons is to learn independance, to understand freedom. This means independence from attachments, from results, from opinions, and from expectations. Breaking attachments leads to freedom, but breaking attachments does not mean abandoning a loving and meaningful relationship, a relationship that nourrishes your soul. It means ending dependency on any person or thing. Love is never a dependency.
Shame isn't a strong enough word for what I feel.  "You could live a hundred lifetimes and not deserve him, you know," Haymitch says.
time made me stronger, you're no longer on my mind
You can't truly hate someone until you've cared about them. Until you've loved them.
I have to go. I have a finite amount of life left and I don't want to spend it arguing with you.
Most women go through life looking for love, and looking for someone to treat them like a queen. For some women finding real love seems to be something that will never happen. I believe that finding love is not as hard as people make it seem. The reason that some women can't find real love is because they look for more than just real love. A lot of women know what they need in a relationship, and thats for a man to love that woman with all of his heart, and to treat her real good. Most women have guys in their life or guys that try to get with them that could really love them and treat them real good. Those are usually the guys that get forced into that friend zone or rejected upfront. See those guys could give them what they need, but not what they want. “Wants” can be anything from a woman wanting a man to have certain materialistic things, or she could want him to look a certain way, those are a few examples of the things that some of them want, but they vary depending on the female. What some females don't understand is that none of the things that they want has anything with love or how that person will treat you. You could find a man that looks perfect, has a house and car, he can be a college graduate with a good job, and you could still end up being with a person that doesn't truly love you, and will treat you like shit. What I am trying to say is that the person who could treat you good and really love you could already be in your life, but you could have been blinded by the things you want in a man so you overlooked the person that you were really looking for. And by the way there are men that do the same thing; I just wanted to be clear on that.
The foundation of adult trust is not "You will never hurt me." It is "I trust myself with whatever you do.
Don't. Don't let's pretend when there's no one around.
Still, she knows one thing for certain: never judge a relationship unless you are the one wrapped up in its arms.
She couldn't be on his wavelength all the time. That's all. When you could recognize that and deal with it, you were on your way to an adult relationship.
They feel life is for the taking, and that everyone deserves happiness no matter what the cost. I must remember these tricks if I ever decide to have my soul surgically removed.
I've found that when you're wrapped up in the process of dating and want so badly to have something work out with someone -anyone- it's easy to forget that your choices aren't limited to one person or the other. There's also the choice I always forget about: To not choose anyone in order to keep myself open to someone who IS right for me.
Sure am glad I'm not royalty," I muttered. "I wouldn't want to have to bump uglies with someone I can't stand. On a regular basis. And no one else." "Ow!" I exclaimed, trying to yank my fingers from Trent but finding them caught. Then I colored, realizing what I'd said. "Oh… sorry," I stammered, meaning it. "That was insensitive." Trent's frown turned into a sly smirk. "Bump uglies?" he said, eyes on the table behind me. "You are a font of gutter slang, Rachel. We must do this again.
Alas, woman is faithful as long as she loves, but you demand that she be faithful without love and give herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel then, woman or man?
It's as if every conversation with a woman was a test, and men always failed it, because they always lacked the key to the code and so they never quite understood what the conversation was really about.
I look at him with the nostalgic affection men are said to feel for their wars, their fellow veterans. I think, I once threw things at this man. I threw a glass ashtray, a fairly cheap one which didn't break. I threw a shoe (his) and a handbag (mine), not even snapping the handbag shut first, so that he was showered with a metal rain of keys and small change. The worst thing I threw was a small portable television set, standing on the bed and heaving it at him with the aid of the bouncy springs, although the instant I let fly I thought, Oh God, let him duck! I once thought I was capable of murdering him. Today I feel only a mild regret that we were not more civilized with each other at the time. Still, it was amazing, all those explosions, that recklessness, that Technicolor wreckage. Amazing and agonizing and almost lethal.
For you she learned to wear a short black slip and red lipstick, how to order a glass of red wine and finish it. She learned to reach out as if to touch your arm and then not touch it, changing the subject. <i>Didn't you think, </i>she'd begin, or <i>Weren't you sorry. . . .</i>  To call your best friends by their schoolboy names and give them kisses good-bye, to look away when they say <i>Your wife</i>! So your confidence grows. She doesn't ask what you want because she knows.  Isn't that what you think?  When actually she was only waiting to be told <i>Take off your dress---</i> to be stunned, and then do this, never rehearsed, but perfectly obvious: in one motion up, over, and gone, the X of her arms crossing and uncrossing, her face flashing away from you in the fabric so that you couldn't say if she was appearing or disappearing.
Alright, good night,” he said, his words a little slurred. “But before I pass out, I want you to know that you’re the hottest biscuit this side of the gravy boat.
If you walked away from a  toxic, negative, abusive,  one-sided, dead-end  low vibrational  relationship or friendship   — you won.
The aching in my chest  isn't because I miss you, it's realizing that you have  become someone I no longer know, your fears, your 4 am thoughts,  your achievements, are things I no longer have an equivalent to. Who we were and who we are  are four different people,  and the me from now  doesn't relate to the me from then,  let alone to the you from now. -Tanzy Sayadi and Jarod Kintz
Everybody deserves love, but nobody is entitled to it.
He announces that lately he keeps losing things. "Like your wife and child," I want to say, but don´t. At fourty, I´ve learned not to say everything clever, not to score every point.
You could say that Elphaba brought us together,' said Boq softly. 'I'm closer to her and so I'm closer to you.'  Galinda seemed to give up. She leaned her head back on the velvet cushions of the swing and said, 'Boq, you know despite myself I think you're a little sweet. You're a little sweet and you're a little charming and you're a little maddening and you're a little habit-forming.'  Boq held his breath.  But you're little!' she concluded. 'You're a Munchkin, for god's sake!'  He kissed her, he kissed her, he kissed her, little by little by little.
He was everything your mother warned you about when she told you not to walk alone in the dark.
I think what I want is for someone to know me. Really know me. Know me better than anyone else and maybe even me. Isn’t that why we commit to another? It’s not for sex. If it were for sex, we wouldn’t marry one person. We’d just keep finding new partners. We commit for many reasons, I know, but the more I think about it, the more I think long-term relationships are for getting to know someone. I want someone to know me, really know me, almost like that person could get into my head. What would that feel like? To have access, to know what it’s like in someone else’s head. To rely on someone else, have him rely on you. That’s not a biological connection like the one between parents and children. This kind of relationship would be chosen. It would be something cooler, harder to achieve than one built on biology and shared genetics. I think that’s it. Maybe that’s how we know when a relationship is real. When someone else previously unconnected to us knows us in a way we never thought or believed possible.
Relationships are so much like the United States - they only really thrive when faced with an external threat.
Love and honesty don’t mix.
Sometimes it's exhausting for me to simply walk into the house. I try and calm myself, remember that I've lived alone before. Sleeping by myself didn't kill me then and will not kill me now. But this what loss has taught me of love. Our house isn't simply <i>empty</i>, our home <i>has been emptied</i>. Love makes a place in your life, it makes a place for itself in your bed. Invisibly, it makes a place in your body, rerouting all your blood vessels, throbbing right alongside your heart. When it's gone, nothing is whole again.
I had a dream about you last night.. You were balancing ten tiny footballs on your nose while dancing with a turquoise unicorn.
[On what young husbands should say to their wives:] I have taken you in my arms, and I love you, and I prefer you to my life itself. For the present life is nothing, and my most ardent dream is to spend it with you in such a way that we may be assured of not being separated in the life reserved for us... I place your love above all things, and nothing would be more bitter or painful to me than to be of a different mind than you.
Trust in someone means that we no longer have to protect ourselves. We believe we will not be hurt or harmed by the other, at least not deliberately. We trust his or her good intentions, though we know we might be hurt by the way circumstances play out between us. We might say that hurt happens; it’s a given of life. Harm is inflicted; it’s a choice some people make.
A person shows signs of clutching on too fast, of being needy, of not hearing the word "no," of jealousy, of guarding you and your freedom. But the signs can be so small they skitter right past you. Sometimes they dance past, looking satiny, something you should applaud. Someone's jealousy can make you feel good. Special. But it's not even about you. It's about a hand that is already gripping. It's about their need, circling around your throat
Sometimes our walls exist just to see who has the strength to knock them down.
In love, women are professionals, men are amateurs
You've got an awfully kissable mouth.
Be careful whom you choose to love. This decision will impact your future life and happiness in ways you cannot yet imagine.
But it became clear very quickly that I'd underestimated how much I liked him. Not him, perhaps, but the fact that I had someone on the other end of an invisible line. Someone to update and get updates from, to inform of a comic discovery, to imagine while dancing in a lonely basement, and to return to, finally, when the music stopped.
You know a relationship has deteriorated past the point of salvage when one person detests another's gestures.
We can't be so desperate for love that we forget where we can always find it; within.
For [erotically intelligent couples], love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure, and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life: time. Marriage is not the end of romance, it is the beginning. They know that they have years in which to deepen their connection, to experiment, to regress, and even to fail. They see their relationship as something alive and ongoing, not a fait accompli. It’s a story that they are writing together, one with many chapters, and neither partner knows how it will end. There’s always a place they haven’t gone yet, always something about the other still to be discovered.
Here was a boy who liked flaws, who saw them not as failings but as strengths. Who knew such a person could exist, or what would have happened if we'd found each other under different circumstances? Maybe in a perfect world. But not in this one.
He gave her a quick, casual kiss on the cheek first. Then came the hug, and it was the hug that always made Laurel’s heart mush. Serious grip, cheek to the hair, eyes closed, just a little sway. Del’s hugs mattered, she thought, and made him impossible to resist.
Just start off with the same goals in mind. If you have the same values, same goals then you'll be on track for the same future.
I loved you at your worst, and you were always at your worst. Nothing could stop me. Not even you.
He needs "space" and "time," as if this were physics and not a human relationship.
Living together/ is one move closer/ to living apart
my only complaints are two: that I didn't make myself ready for you sooner in life, that I can't give you better, Love you more.
Hating hurts the hater the most. Hating is not a salve for the wounded soul, it is an abrasive that keeps the soul wounded and raw and oversensitive.
You might think that a boy is just your friend, but then if you find out that maybe he likes you (in a boyfriend way), everything changes instantly. (47)
You will be a great queen when you come back, you know. And someday you'll love me the way you love your wolf.
That's one of the first things that comes out of young people's mouths when they're in love. FOREVER. And that's cool, it's all good-until you get old enough to realize what forever is.
I wonder if it is possible to have two boyfriends. I mean, times are changing. Relationships are more complicated. In France men always have mistresses and wives and so on. Henri probably has two girlfriends. He would laugh if you told him you just had one. He would say, <i>'C'est tres, tres tragique.'</i>
To touch a person...to sleep with a person...is to become a pioneer," she whispered then, "a frontiersman at the edge of their private world, the strange, incomprehensible world of their interior, filled with customs you could never imitate, a language which sounds like your own but is really totally foreign, knowable only to them.
If you haven't cried at least once while writing a chapter of your inspirational book, then you have to ask yourself if your're writing fiction.
For the first time in his life he understood why the Bible called sex "knowing". Everything was different. Now he <i>knew</i> Dante. He'd known Dante. And wonder of wonders, Dante had known him right back.
How do you know? How best to ensure his nervous breakdown?" I ask.  "Keep going," Christian says. "Just go on as if nothing has happened. We all hate that.
Just because you discover that you may like somebody after all, it doesn't necessarily mean there's any attraction.
I had a dream about you last night... you kept meowing at people and licking yourself it was not unlike you normally.
It's like the old question, "Do you lock your house to keep people out, or to protect what's inside?" Should a person act modestly and dress modestly in order to prevent intrusion from the outside, undesirable things from happening, or to preserve and maintain what is inside: the delicate and sensitive ability to have and maintain an intimate relationship.
And you can't have two stars in one relationship. Somebody has to be willing to be the wagon...at lease some of the time
Don’t spoil me with your lies, love me with your truth.
Don't be a fool. Don't give up something important to hold onto someone who can't even say they love you.
She knew how breakups went from hearing other girls complain about them. First the pulling away, the gradual refusal to return notes or phone calls. The vague messages saying nothing was wrong, that the other person just needed a little space. Then the speech about how "It's not you, it's me." Then the crying part.  She'd never thought any of that would apply to her and Jace. What they had wasn't ordinary, or subject to the ordinary rules of relationships and breakups. They belonged to each other totally, and always will, and that was that.  But maybe everyone felt that way? Until the moment they realized they were just like everyone else, and everyone they'd thought was real shattered apart.
To gaze into another persons face is to do two things: to recognise their humanity and to assert your own.
Once you embrace your value, talents and strengths, it neutralizes when others think less of you.
One of the most difficult things he'd ever done was turn away and leave her standing in the shadows.
<b>I KNEW IT WAS OVER</b>  when tonight you couldn't make the phone ring when you used to make the sun rise when trees used to throw themselves in front of you to be paper for love letters that was how i knew i had to do it  swaddle the kids we never had against january's cold slice bundle them in winter clothes they never needed so i could drop them off at my mom's even though she lives on the other side of the country and at this late west coast hour is assuredly east coast sleeping peacefully  her house was lit like a candle the way homes should be warm and golden and home and the kids ran in and jumped at the bichon frise named lucky that she never had they hugged the dog it wriggled and the kids were happy yours and mine the ones we never had and my mom was  grand maternal, which is to say, with style that only comes when you've seen enough to know grace  like when to pretend it's christmas or a birthday so she lit her voice with tiny lights and pretended she didn't see me crying  as i drove away to the hotel connected to the bar where i ordered the cheapest whisky they had  just because it shares your first name because they don't make a whisky called <i>baby</i> and i only thought what i got was what i ordered  i toasted the hangover inevitable as sun that used to rise in your name  i toasted the carnivals we never went to and the things you never won for me the ferris wheels we never kissed on and all the dreams between us that sat there like balloons on a carney's board waiting to explode with passion but slowly deflated hung slave under the pin- prick of a tack  hung heads down like lovers when it doesn't work, like me at last call after too many cheap  too many sweet too much whisky makes me sick, like the smell of cheap,  like the smell of the dead  like the cheap, dead flowers you never sent that i never threw out of the window of a car i never really owned
I'm terrified of getting involved with someone who disappoints me or leaves me empty and alone. I'm terrified of rejection, so I set my expectations so high that they can never be met, and I dig around with a magnifying glass looking for flaws in very person I date. There's always a flaw to exploit, and I'll find it so I never have to get too close.
People can attach themselves to something--an idea, another person, a desire--with an impossibly strong grip, and in the case of restless ghosts, a grip stronger than death. Will is a powerful thing. Will--it's supposed to be a good treat, a more determined and persistent version of determination and persistence. But will and obsession--they sit right next to each other. They pretend to be strangers and all the while meet secretly at midnight." -
Then I imagined a lifetime of having to cry to get him to be kind, and I went back to no again.
Terkadang,yang tak bisa kamu lupakan  adalah seseorang yang tak pernah bisa kamu miliki.
Everyone has their first date and the object is to hide your flaws. And then you're in a relationship, and it's all about hiding your disappointment. And then, once you're married, it's about hiding your sins.
It is the same way with dating. The time you are most prepared for dating is when you don't need anyone to complete you, fulfill you, or instill in you a sense of worth or purpose.
Love, he realized, was like the daggers he made in his forge: When you first got one it was shiny and new and the blade glinted bright in the light. Holding it against your palm, you were full of optimism for what it would be like in the field, and you couldn't wait to try it out. Except those first couple of nights out were usually awkward as you got used to it and it got used to you.  Over time, the steel lost its brand-new gleam, and the hilt became stained, and maybe you nicked the shit out of the thing a couple of times. What you got in return, however, saved your life: Once the pair of you were well acquainted, it became such a part of you that it was an extension of your own arm. It protected you and gave you a means to protect your brothers; it provided you with the confidnece and the power to face whatever came out of the night; and wherever you went, it stayed with you, right over your heart, always there when you needed it.  You had to keep the blade up, however. And rewrap the hilt from time to time. And double-check the weight.  Funny...all of that was <i>well, duh</i> when it came to weapons. Why hadn't it dawned on him that matings were the same?  (From the thoughts of Vishous)
Life had sure been simpler when I hadn't dated.
Ordinarily, I am the person who falls in love quickly and somewhat inappropriately and then goes on to destroy what is a good thing. That's always been my style. So, you know: I get it. And I feel right now the way I imagine all those guys felt with me. And I have to say, for the first time in my life, I feel something approaching compassion for them.
Sometimes you met someone that changed the pattern, who wormed their way past the cracks in your heart, caulked them up, sealed themselves in, and stayed there. Sometimes they did it by insisting you meet them at every step, as Jamie had done to me.
No, I am never setting foot in this house again it scares me and makes me sad and I wish you could be a mom whose eyes worked but I don't think you can.
Who does ever get what they want? It doesn’t seem to happen to many of us if any at all. It’s always two people bumping against each other blindly, acting out old ideas and dreams and mistaken understandings.
Miscommunication is endless.
The best baby-sitters, of course, are the baby’s grandparents. You feel completely comfortable entrusting your baby to them for long periods, which is why most grandparents flee to Florida.
I still think I love him more. It's one of those things you never know for certain because there's no way to enter all the relationship data in a computer and have it spit out a definitive answer. You can't quantify love, and if you try, you wind up focusing on misleading factors.
Why, you are a man of heart!" "Sometimes," replied Phileas Fogg, quietly. "When I have the time.
The manlier you are, the harder it is to understand what a woman wants: there is not a hint of female brain in you.
Sometimes, if she simply remained quiet, and let the inadequacy of his excuses reverberate on the air, he became ashamed and backtracked.
Maybe that's what love is. Having someone who guides you through different experiences, coaxes you to try news things but still makes you feel safe.
That they were left with only this--this awkward, prearranged meet-up, this terrible silence--seemed almost more than she could bear, and the unfairness of it all welled up inside of her. It was his fault, all of it, and yet her hatred for him was the worst kind of love, a tortured longing, a misguided wish that made her heart hammer in her chest. She couldn't ignore the disjointed sensation that they were now two different pieces of two different puzzles, and nothing in the world could make them fit together again.
~Do you like him much? ~I told you I like him a little. Where is the use of caring for him so very much? He is full of faults. ~Is he? ~All boys are. ~More than girls? ~Very likely. Wise people say it is folly to think anyboy perfect, and as to likes and diskiles, we should be friendly to all, and worship none.
I would be consumed by you,' she said, and blinked her eyes furiously when she felt them fill with tears. 'You would sap all the energy and all the joy from me. You would put out all the fire of my vitality.'  'Give me a chance to fan the flames of that fire,' he said, 'and to nurture your joy.
Our happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people: family and friends and neighbors and the woman you hardly notice who cleans your office. Happiness is not a noun or verb. It's a conjunction. Connective tissue.
Insanity is everyone expecting you not to fall apart when you find out everything you believed in was a lie.
The only real battle in life is between hanging on and letting go.
I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him.
Sometimes the door closes on a relationship, not because we failed but because something bigger than us says this no longer fits our life. So, lock the door, shed a tear, turn around and look for the new door that's opened. It's a sign that you're no longer that person you were, it's time to change into who you are. It's going to be okay.
It seemed that we loved each other better when there were large swaths of two continents between us. The daily work of love was often hard to perform at home.
Often people that settle in life are those that only do what they can with what they have and where they are. Never settle for someone that didn't know your worth from the beginning, or build a life without God in it. Live beyond your low expectations.
You want the fairy tale."  "I want a chance at it.
What's agitating about solitude is the inner voice telling you that you should be mated to somebody, that solitude is a mistake. The inner voice doesn't care about who you find. It just keeps pestering you, tormenting you--if you happen to be me--with homecoming queens first, then girls next door, and finally anybody who might be pleased to see you now and then at the dinner table and in bed on occasion. You look up from reading the newspaper and realize that no one loves you, and no one burns for you.
Why, then, did I always feel as if his happiness was my responsibility? It wasn't fair for him to burden me with that. It had never been fair.
Even if toxic people are right about what is "good," they are wrong if the approach is not healthy.
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that because honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had!
You lose yourself, Erica, because with the right person, who you become together is something so much greater, more than you could even realize right now.
If somebody never gets enough of you, they will always want more
We need to bridge our sense of loneliness and disconnection with a sense of community and continuity even if we must manufacture it from our time on the Web and our use of calling cards to connect long distance. We must “log on” somewhere, and if it is only in cyberspace, that is still far better than nowhere at all. (264)
And since I’m marrying into the Quartet, I have certain privileges and duties. If you’re sleeping with Laurel—” “I’m not sleeping with Laurel. We’re dating.” “Right, and the two of you are just going to hold hands, admire the moon, and sing camp songs.” “For a while. Minus the singing.
Tina leans forward and asks quietly, 'Do you? You know? Love her?' Squeezing Nat’s knee again, I reply, 'She’s teachin’ me how.
Isn't everyone a part of everyone else?
As I saw it,  all my mother's life, my father  held her down, like  lead strapped to her ankles.  She was buoyant by nature; she wanted to travel, go to the theater, go to museums. What he wanted was to lie on the couch with the Times over his face, so that death, when it came, wouldn't seem a significant change.
Marriage: a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully omitted to investigate.
What's the difference?" You ask me The difference is, a smile touches my lips When I remember both the memory of you entering my life And the memory of you leaving my life
Forgiveness is created by the restitution of the abuser; of the wrongdoer. It is not something to be squeeeeeezed out of the victim in a further act of conscience-corrupting abuse.
I didn't dream about you last night. I woke up in fear.
Only love that continues to flow in the face of anger, blame, and indifference can be called love. All else is simply a transaction.
God is great and God is good," Lisa says. "But where are the Apache attack helicopters when you need them?
Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.
Anya looked upon Nin admirably. Having him as a partner-in-crime—if only on this one occasion, which she hoped would only be the start of something more—was more revitalizing than the cheap thrills of a cookie-cutter shallow, superficial romance, where the top priority was how beautiful a person was on the outside.
There is something beautiful about watching two people lovingly act silly together; behaving as though no one else existed.
Our lives were now worlds apart, separated by time, circumstance, and the unbridgeable chasm of money.
The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill as ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious perversion of physics- as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules
Happy wife, happy life.
Unless I understand the Cross, I cannot understand why my commitment to what is right must be precedence over what I prefer.
When we replace a sense of service and gratitude with a sense of entitlement and expectation, we quickly see the demise of our relationships, society, and economy.
I was flipping channels, watching this cheerleading program on MTV. They took a field hockey girl and “transformed” her into a cheerleader by the end of the show. I was just wondering: what if she liked field hockey better?
I believe that it is impossible for two individuals not committed to their own and each other’s well being to sustain a healthy and enduring relationship.
I barely know him. I guess that is every relationship. You start with nothing and maybe end with everything.
She needed the chaos within her in order to discover the extraordinary no man could ever reach.
I loved you because there was no other place for me to go. We were married because we did not know what else to do with each other. You never knew me, nothing about me, what died inside me, what lived invisibly.
In the realm of love and sex, it’s girls who are in the position of working hard to adapt themselves to the needs and fantasies of the mercurial males whose approval and attention they seek.
I wanted to have a good relationship. One that's romantic and dramatic, like in the movies. But I finally became a woman at 17 and learned that men aren't really that simple.
There was a tacit understanding between them that 'liquor helped'; growing more miserable with every glass one hoped for the moment of relief.
Before her marriage she had thought that she had love within her grasp; but since the happiness which she had expected this love to bring her hadn’t come, she supposed she must have been mistaken. And Emma tried to imagine just what was meant, in life, by the words “bliss,” “passion,” and “rapture” - words that had seemed so beautiful to her in books.
You never know who's waiting for you and you never know when love is coming your way or who it might be. But let me just say, a healthy relationship requires SACRIFICE and DEDICATION.
The best defense is a confusing offense.
Better not to invent her in her absence. Better to wait until she's actually here. Then he can make her up as she goes along.
Take me now, God!" I shout to the inky sky. "I´m ready." "You´re not ready. You´re not even divorced yet," Bunny says. "You cannot die married to that man.
I wish I hadn't. I wish I'd fought for you. I was weak and stupid.
It was a bitter moment for us. We weren't two mature parents. We were just two kids playing grown-up. We still needed Mommy and Daddy's permission, blessings, and money to survive.
Hereafter she is only my sister in name; not because I disown her, but because she has disowned me.
God is even in a single parent household.
I had a dream about you last night. We stopped telling each other about our dreams when we realized we were still inside them.
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide, By self-example mayst thou be denied.
Failed relationships can be described as so much wasted makeup. Forget the laughs, forget the fights, forget the sex, forget the jealousy. But take off your hat and observe a moment's silence for the legions of unknown tubes of foundation, mascara, eyeliner, blusher and lipstick who died that it might all have been possible. But who died in vain.
We were friends and have become estranged. But this was right, and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we had reason to feel ashamed. We are two ships each of which has its goal and course; our paths may cross and we may celebrate a feast together, as we did - and then the good ships rested so quietly in one harbor and one sunshine that it may have looked as if they had reached their goal and as if they had one goal. But then the mighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into different seas and sunny zones, and perhaps we shall never see each other again; perhaps we shall meet again but fail to recognize each other: our exposure to different seas and suns has changed us.
Disagreement is not necessarily a reason to head for Splitsville. In fact, a relationship without disagreement is probably too brittle to last. Some of the best human bonds are forged in the fire of disagreement.
Everything else has vanished, so you take them now. Maybe if you're the one keeping them, I'll be the one feeling better.
Too many doubts grow in the cracks of silence and separation.
I don't want you to be young and beautiful. I only want one thing. I want you to be kind-hearted - and not just towards cats and dogs.
In marriage, each partner is to be an encourager rather than a critic; a forgiver rather than a collector of hurts; an enabler rather than a reformer.
In love, treat your relationship as if you are growing the most beautiful flower. Keep watering it, tend to its roots, give it lots of sunlight, and always make sure the petals are full of color and are never curling. Once you neglect your plant, it will die, as will your relationship.
I guess it can’t be too often that two people can laugh and make love, too, make love because they are laughing, laugh because they’re making love. The love and the laughter come from the same place: but not many people go there
What was it about relationships that made you feel so vulnerable? Oh, right. A relationship. In any relationship, you put yourself out there. You exposed all of your sensitive nerve endings and your heart and you just had to hope that you trusted the right person.
If I say your voice is an amber waterfall in which I yearn to burn each day, if you eat my mouth like a mystical rose with powers of healing and damnation, If I confess that your body is the only civilization I long to experience… would it mean that we are close to knowing something about love?
There is a relationship between the eye contacts we make and the perceptions that we create in our heads, a relationship between the sound of another's voice and the emotions that we feel in our hearts, a relationship between our movements in space all around us and the magnetic pulls we can create between others and ourselves. All of these things (and more) make up the magic of every ordinary day and if we are able to live in this magic, to feel and to dwell in it, we will find ourselves living with magic every day. These are the white spaces in life, the spaces in between the written lines, the cracks in which the sunlight filters into. Some of us swim in the overflowing of the wine glass of life, we stand and blink our eyes in the sunlight reaching unseen places, we know where to find the white spaces, we live in magic.
It is with the soul that we grasp the essence of another human being, not with the mind, nor even with the heart.
Become the leader of your life. Lead yourself to where you want to be. Breathe life back into your ambitions, your desires, your goals, your relationships.
Give a girl a boyfriend and she becomes a total expert on relationships
I was aware that we were both silently making those inevitable comparisons, putting our relationship in context. She is more this and less that. He is better or worse in these ways. It is human nature to do this--unless its your first relationship, which might be the very reason that your first relationship feels special and remains forever sacred. But the older you get, the more cynical you become, and the more complicated and convoluted the exercise is. You begin to realize that nothing is perfect, that there are trade-offs and sacrifices. The worst is when someone in your past trumps the person in the present, and you think to yourself: if I'd known this, then maybe I wouldn't have let him go.
I don't even know her yet..but if she could see me right now, I'd want her to know that I love her
Two people with mental issues in a relationship does not work. It's like sitting in a boat and neither one has an oar to row the other to shore. You can meet your mirror image in life, but that doesn't mean you should marry him.
And when all your faith is gone let it be me, if it's a friend you need let it be me
From someone who doesn't want to share your destiny, you should neither accept a cigarette
When a girl uses six derogatory adjectives in her attempt to paint the portrait of the loved one, it means something. One may indicate a merely temporary tiff. Six is big stuff.
It is the mind which creates the world around us, and even though we stand side by side in the same meadow, my eyes will never see what is beheld by yours, my heart will never stir to the emotions with which yours is touched.
A break up is the closest thing to bereavement
Women, in general, will find it difficult to turn from a man and stop demanding that he meets their needs, provides security, and protects their identity, and return to me. Men, in general, find it very hard to turn from the works of their hands, their own quests for power and security and significance, and turn to me.
Love is beyond reason. Love is not measurable in words. Love cannot be partial; it cannot have owners. Love is essentially beyond definition or concept.
Ain't No Drama Like Bedroom Drama
Understand the nature and influence of repeating patterns, from childhood experiences or even from past lives. Wthout understanding, patterns tend to repeat, unnecessarily damaging the relationship.
There is nothing right or wrong in love. Where there is love, then there is nothing but only love.
In relationships, there are no beginning and no end.
Mismatches destroy us all, even the most tender ones, and most never have the courage to break someone else's heart to follow their own.
I had a dream about you last night... you were there.
If I have to 'catch' a man to get a husband, I don't want one.
why provide relationship benefits to someone who claims they don't want a relationship...
Better guilt than the terrible burden of freedom and responsibility.
Jump, if you want to, ‘cause I’ll catch you, girl. I’ll catch you “fore you fall. Go as far inside as you need to, I’ll hold your ankles. Make sure you get back out. I’m not saying this because I need a place to stay. That’s the last thing I need. I told you, I’m a walking man, but I been heading in this direction for seven years. Walking all around this place. Upstate, downstate, east, west; I been in territory ain’t got no name, never staying nowhere long. But when I got here and sat out there on the porch, waiting for you, well, I knew it wasn’t the place I was heading toward; it was you. We can make a life, girl. A life.
Sacrifices made for love are fine, unless the sacrifice is you.
You aren't alive if you aren't in need.
Love is not the perfect match, love is the connection between two people.
I had a dream about you last night. We were plug sockets in the bedroom. We saw only a short part of their day, but we knew everything of it.
She preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were less manageable.
An honorable human relationship – that is, one in which two people have the right to use the word "love" – is a process, delicate, violent, often terrifying to both persons involved, a process of refining the truths they can tell each other.  It is important to do this because it breaks down human self-delusion and isolation.  It is important to do this because in doing so we do justice to our own complexity.  It is important to do this because we can count on so few people to go that hard way with us.
Perhaps love is a minor madness. And as with madness, it's unendurable alone. The one person who can relieve us is of course the sole person we cannot go to: the one we love. So instead we seek out allies, even among strangers and wives, fellow patients who, if they can't touch the edge of our particular sorrow, have felt something that cuts nearly as deep.
When a man has seen the woman whom he would have chosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his.
A wedding is and event, but marriage is a life.
But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people--first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy.
Its dark and I’m reading my scars because our moments remind me of where I should be.
It's always seemed to me that flirtation is a man's device for avoiding responsibility. He can say whatever he wants and knows he won't be taken seriously.
Shall there be truth between us, as two men? Not as friends, but as enemies and equals?
You're only responsible for being honest, not for someone else's reaction to your honesty.
There's something I have to say," I said seriously, looking her in the eye.  She smiled. "Oookay." She was mocking me-mocking my tone-but I didn't care.  "Okay. Here it is. I love you," I said. "And I never, ever wanted to hurt you. It's like, the number one thing I never want to do, but somehow, I keep doing it. And I'm sorry, I just...that's all I wanted to say all this time. All I was trying to do...with that thing with your dad, not telling you...was not to hurt you. And I'm sorry that I did.  Alley stared at me.  "And I'm sorry that I did it again. With the Chloe thing. Which was stupid. Like, really, really, stupid. And I-"  "Can you just stop, for a second?" Ally said, holding up a hand.  "What?" I said.  "Can you say the first part again?" she asked, rolling her fingers around for a rewind.  I racked my brain.  "Um...I love you?" I said.  "That's the part, Cuz I love you, too.
Just remember that the only question in a house is who is to rule. The rest is only dancing around that, trying not to look it in the eye.
One has only to set a loved human being against the fact that we are all in peril all the time to get back a sense of proportion. What does anything matter compared to the reality of love and its span, so brief at best, maintained against such odds?
When certain parts of our bodies are touched, certain enzymes and chemicals that trigger sexual desire are released into our system. The more our bodies are stimulated, the more chemicals are released and the greater our sexual desire grows until it becomes a virtually unstoppable flood.
Women were excited after sex, wired becasue in their minds the relationship was on beginning. Men went to sleep m the because for the orgasm had arrived and the relationship was done.
He was one of those quite rare adults who communicate with small children fairly well and who love them all impartially--not in a sugary way but in a businesslike fashion that may sometimes entail a hug, in the same way that closing a big business deal may call for a handshake.
I spend the rest of the afternoon trying to explain to Zoe one of the very saddest notions in love and life: sometimes the timing is wrong--and sometimes you realize the heart of the matter way to late in the game.
There is no formula to relationships. They have to be negotiated in loving ways, with room for both parties, what they want and what they need, what they can do and what their life is like.
For someone who is supposed to be a knight in shining armor, you're acting like an ass in aluminum foil.
Being faithful and monogamous is not natural for human beings. It takes work. Deep down we all know that. We have all been tempted to stray at some point or another. Even when it was only a fleeting thought and we didn't act on it. Every time we acknowledge that someone of the opposite sex is "attractive" or "sexy" we are doing nothing other than pointing out that they would be a suitable mate. Not acting on that natural impulse to want to mate with a viable mating partner requires a conscious decision. It's a constant struggle between what your body wants, and what the civilized part of your brain says you should do, in order to avoid the negative consequences of cheating on your spouse and ruining your long-term relationship. That's why affairs, and extra-marital sex, are often referred to as "a moment of weakness.
Undeniable chemistry and horrific timing. They love each other.
Young love is so ridiculous, as is middle-aged and old love. And it’s also hilarious. When have you ever felt so vulnerable and wonderful and terrible at the same time?
Traveling in a third-world country is the closest thing there is to being married and raising kids. You have glorious hikes and perfect days on the beach. You go on adventures you would never try, or enjoy, alone. But you also can't get away from each other. Everything is unfamiliar. Money is tight or you get robbed. Someone gets sick or sunburned. You get bored. It is harder than you expected, but you are glad you didn't just sit home.
The best relationships are between two people who care more about each other's good than their own momentary pleasure.
Just because lips have met doesn't mean hearts have joined. And just because two bodies are drawn to each other doesn't mean two people are right for each other. A physical relationship does not equal love.
I think she cared more for that bloody dog than for me, for us. And maybe that's not so stupid, looking back... maybe it is easier living on your own looking after some stupid mutt than sharing your life with other actual human beings.
It is so simple, yet so hard for some people to do. If you want someone out of your life then you and only “you” must tell him or her to leave. This can only be done by you. Otherwise, your silence shouts, “I am undecided.” When other people get involved it sends mixed signals. If only more people would be so bold, hearts would not linger so long.
I realize the thing about a guy you've spent your whole life loving from afar is that even though he's real you've really made most of him up.
I had a dream about you last night.. You thought you were a candy vampire, you were standing in the sun screaming 'I'm melting.
I had a dream about you last night... I was a brick and you were a blanket. Damn that improbability drive.
Love doesn't make the world go 'round; love is what makes the ride worthwhile.
Each piece of glass is another piece of myself I gave to him.   It's too bad I didn't keep any pieces for myself.
I know how you feel because I’ve been there too. I’ve hated and I’ve loved. I’ve seen my demons root and crawl and my angels branch and soar. I've died within myself and lived a thousand different lives. I too fight the same war and I too am drowning in the puddles of self-consciousness this world created.
People are meant to go through life two by two. ’Tain’t natural to be lonesome.
A pure heart is superlatively rare and even more attractive.
As for myself: I had come to the conclusion that there was nothing sacred about myself or any human being, that we were all machines, doomed to collide and collide and collide. For want of anything better to do, we became fans of collisions. Sometimes I wrote well about collisions, which meant I was a writing machine in good repair. Sometimes I wrote badly, which meant I was a writing machine in bad repair. I no more harbored sacredness than did a Pontiac, a mousetrap, or a South Bend Lathe.
Look for the heart in a man before you look at what he has.
...there remained a strange formality between them, and her pleasure in his presence felt too much like missing him had felt during the last week.
I live for sex.   I celebrate it, and relish the electricity of it, with every fibre of my being.   I can see no better reason for being alive.
A Plan B life can be just as good or better than a Plan A life. You just have to let go of that first dream and realize that God has already written the first chapter of the new life that awaits you. All you have to do is start reading!
A woman may be beautiful but have poor character. A man may be a business genius, making money left and right, but lack common courtesy, sensitivity, and compassion.
He looked at her and tried to discover behind her lascivious expression the familiar features that he loved tenderly. It was as if he were looking at two images through the same lens, at two images superimposed one on the other with one showing through the other. These two images showing through each other were telling him that <i>everything</i> was in the girl, that her soul was terrifyingly amorphous, that it held faithfulness and unfaithfulness, treachery and innocence, flirtatiousness and chastity. This disorderly jumble seemed disgusting to him, like the variety to be found in a pile of garbage. Both images continued to show through each other, and the young man understood that the girl differed only on the surface from other women, but deep down was the same as they: full of all possible thoughts, feelings, and vices, which justified all his secret misgivings and fits of jealousy. The impression that certain outlines delineated her as an individual was only a delusion to which the other person, the one who was looking, was subject--namely himself. It seemed to him that the girl he loved was a creation of his desire, his thoughts, and his faith and that the <i>real</i> girl now standing in front of him was hopelessly other, hopelessly alien, hopelessly <i>ambiguous</i>. He hated her.
A while back, when Dick &amp; Barry &amp; I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you *are* like, Barry proposed the idea of a questionnaire for potential partners, a 2 or 3 page multiple-choice document that covered all the music/film/TV/book bases. It was intended: a) to dispense with awkward conversation, and b) to prevent a chap from leaping into bed with someone who might, at a later date, turn out to have every Julio Iglesias record ever made. It amused us at the time... But there was an important &amp; essential truth contained in the idea, and the truth was that these things matter, and it's no good pretending that any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently, or if your favorite films wouldn't even speak to each other if they met at a party.
[novan]: bassists are very good with their fingers [novan]: and some of us sing backup vocals, so that means we're good with our mouths too...  (~ IM chat with Novan Chang, 18, bassist)
It's not other people that hurt us, but what we feel about them
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth.
There are only two ways to live your life. One as if all that matters is to have someone love and accept you. The other is as though loving and accepting another person is all that matters. Often, when you choose the second you get the first.
If the sound of happy children is grating on your ears, I don't think it's the children who need to be adjusted.
I don't talk with everybody because i am not everybody, i am single.
You wouldn't believe that so much could change just because a relationship ended.
Faithfulness in small things leads to faithfulness in great things, and never the other way around.
It is in our relations with other people that we gain a sense of ourselves; it's that, pretty much, that makes relations with other people unbearable.
Among the many answers I have found, I believe love is the most beautiful and simple art that reflects the beauty of life.
We cannot win in team situations or in relationships by ourselves. It is like trying to pick up a pencil with only one finger...Even if that one finger is extremely strong, it will prove almost impossible to pick up that pencil unless you use your other fingers or some other part of your hand. Teamwork is a bit like using all of your fingers. Each one is unique and contributes something different, but they unite in pursuit of a common goal.
Trust is not a gasoline-soaked blanket that succumbs to the matches of betrayal, never able to be used for its warmth again; it’s a tapestry that wears thin in places, but can be patched over if you have the right materials, circumstances, and patience to repair it. If you don’t, you’re always the one who feels the coldest when winter comes.
Love tames the benumbed beast. A man is put to use regarding a woman's physical safety, but a woman is put to use regarding a man's mental safety.
The seeking of a mate shall be undertaken with due preparation and care. A life-bond should never be contemplated as a light thing--unlike a legal union or sanctified joining, the sealing of souls CANNOT be severed. When a mate is SOULBOUND to another--LIFEMATED, as some have come to regard it--a mystery is engaged. In one aspect mystical, the lifemating process is the most sublime endeavor that a Refarian may assume. Once formed, the bond must be ever cherished and nurtured by the process of lifelong rigor.
Dumped doesn't even begin to describe it. If you're going to use a trash metaphor, incinerated is more like it.
I was going to say the beginning is the good part, when it's all sparks and sparkles, before they are inevitably unmasked as assholes.
You cannot connect with anyone except through reality.
Having a sister or a friend is like sitting at night in a lighted house. Those outside can watch you if they want, but you need not see them. You simply say, "Here are the perimeters of our attention. If you prowl around under the windows till the crickets go silent, we will pull the shades. If you wish us to suffer your envious curiosity, you must permit us not to notice it." Anyone with one solid human bond is that smug, and it is the smugness as much as the comfort and safety that lonely people covet and admire.
Every advantage is temporary.
It was told to me, it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects, and told me, as I thought, with triumph. This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested; and it has not been only once; I have had her hopes and exultations to listen to again and again. I have known myself to be divided from Edward forever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me. I have had to content against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother, and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at the time when, as you too well know, it has not been my only unhappiness. If you can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that I have suffered <i>now</i>.
Marriage as a long conversation. - When marrying you should ask yourself this question: do you believe you are going to enjoy talking with this woman into your old age? Everything else in a marriage is transitory, but most of the time that you're together will be devoted to conversation.
I love you," he said, his voice catching. "When I thought you were going to die, I wanted to die.
I always watch you. You consume my every thought.
With all honesty, somewhere between the hello and the dreams I saw you in I fell in love.
At the end of the day I went to this place where your memories left footsteps on my skin and the breath of your touch stained my desire. Yea, it was one of those nights where I needed you the most.
Is it not the great end of religion, and, in particular, the glory of Christianity, to extinguish the malignant passions; to curb the violence, to control the appetites, and to smooth the asperities of man; to make us compassionate and kind, and forgiving one to another; to make us good husbands, good fathers, good friends; and to render us active and useful in the discharge of the relative social and civil duties?
Then we’re just sitting there, staring at each other. Which has been happening a lot lately. It’s like whatever wall there was between us, however she was holding herself back from me . . . all of that pretense is gone. “And when you find a soul mate,” Sara says, “it’s undeniable. You have to be together.” “That’s my philosophy.” I look back at her. “You have to go with the flow.” “Exactly. I think the universe guides you to make the right choices.” “Do you believe in fate?” “I guess, but . . . it’s more about creating the life you want so you can make that fate a reality. You know?
No, I don't think I could fall in love with him, handsome though he is, because I don't accept any of that huff he gives me about my great beauty and all that. I'd have to trust a man's words before I could love him. I think.
The old Amy, the girl of the big laugh and the easy ways, literally shed herself, a pile of skin and soul on the floor, and stepped this new, brittle, bitter Amy ... a razor-wire knot daring me to unloop her, and I was not up to the job with my thick, numb, nervous fingers. Country fingers. Flyover fingers untrained in the intricate, dangerous work of 'solving Amy'. When I'd hold up the bloody stumps, she'd sigh and turn to her secret mental notebooks on which she tallied all my deficiencies, forever noting disappointments, frailties, shortcomings.
She wasn't broken. She was just bent, over the chance of being ignored by the one she loved.
I love you, he thought, because you are honest with me and because you are willing to speak the truth to me when others might seek to curry favor instead. I love you because you are in this bed with me, not trying to conceive the much-awaited next generation of Windhams, but just holding my hand.  -- Gayle Windham
The day he moved out was terrible –  That evening she went through hell. His absence wasn’t a problem But the corkscrew had gone as well.
Everyone disliked their partners at some time or another, she knew that. But she’d spent her hours in the dark wondering whether she’d ever liked him. Would it really have been so much worse to spend those years alone? Why did there have to be someone else in the room while she was eating, watching TV, sleeping?
Wearing a condom is like eating an icecream cone with a sock on your tongue.
But some relationships aren't meant to last.  They are worthy only till the time the two persons involved have time for each other.  They do not know eternity. They live for the present, the "now". And when distance plays it part, or life turns out to be busy, they fall apart.  And may be that's why they're never termed "LOVE". They simply remain what they were - mere RELATIONSHIPS.
It’s the people we hardly know, and not our closest friends, who will improve our lives most dramatically
All the black leather she needs  is the E-Z boy recliner where her love is parked  with one of his hands wrapped around a remote, the other, a bottle of beer.  She's right. It's kinky. The way he doesn't look away  from the TV, as her head bobs  in his lap like a fisherman's float  on a nature program, hectic  with the pace his breath sets.  His crotch swells under her mouth's  prowess. He's such a sweetheart  he waits until the  commercials to come.
She seemed to think that one of the perks of marriage was that it gave you rights of comment and intrusion over single people's love lives.
I had a dream about you last night. We went to the store cupboard to make out, but we ended up sharing our pain and then crying together. We wasn't prepared for this level of intimacy.
I had a dream about you last night... You turned red, then green, and then blue. You told me you were trying to fit in with the m&amp;m's.
Relationships unlock certain parts of who we are supposed to be.
There is no key to open the heart of another - except curiosity.
I had a dream about you last night.. You kept screaming at Ted Danson to pour you a drink.
I had a dream about you last night... Well I say dream I mean nightmare... you were a Yankee fan.
I had a dream about you last night.. You were in the amazon rain forest yipping like a dog.
I had a dream about you last night... You tried to propose with a digital ceramic heater.
I had a dream about you. You were being hung. I had a sword in one hand and a stool in the other. I couldn’t decide which one to use, so I stood on the stool and threw myself on the sword. It was the least I could do to protest capital punishment.
The heart is like a woman, and the head is like a man, and although man is the head of woman, woman is the heart of man, and she turns man's head because she turns his heart.
dealing with any man means dealing with multiple personalities.
Love is supposed to be based on trust, and trust on love, it's something rare and beautiful when people can confide in each other without fearing what the other person will think.
When a man plays with your heart it is for one of two reasons: He knows he can or he is undecided.
If you do not respect your own wishes, no one else will. You will simply attract people who disrespect you as much as you do.
Faith doesn't get you around problems in life and relationships, it gets you through it.
Uh-uh, dude. I tried it your way with the dating and the girls and the kissing and the drama, and man, I didn't like it. Plus, my best friend is a walking cautionary tale of what happens to you when romantic relationships don't involve marriage. Like you always say, kafir, everything ends in breakup, divorce, or death. I want to narrow my misery options to divorce or death - that's all.
Don't feed your ego with my soul.
If I knew how a lot of my relationships would have turned out, I never would have gotten involved in them... And I would have missed out on some of the best times in my life.
Some people are oil and water.
People don't get to our ages without having pasts. I'm more interested in the future.
Miro, I'm so sorry. I always felt such pity for you humans because you could only think of one thing at a time and your memories were so imperfect and . . . now I realize that just getting through the day without killing somebody can be an achievement."  It gets to be a habit. Most of us manage to keep our body count quite low. It's the neighborly way to live.
At your absolute best, you still won't be good enough for the wrong person. At your worst, you'll still be worth it to the right person.
You can only trust your emotions as you can lie to yourself with your brain but not your heart.
There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy.
I decided that giving a girl a ring when you're not in a serious relationship is sort of like giving a guy a blow job when you have no real feelings for him. It makes everything feel a little cheap.It cheapens the giver and the recipient.
Parker: She believed, absolutely, that each person, each heart, had a counterpart—had a mate. A rightness. She’d always believed it, and understood that unshakable belief was a reason she was good at what she did.
Mine Enemy is growing old -- I have at last Revenge -- The Palate of the Hate departs -- If any would avenge   Let him be quick -- the Viand flits -- It is a faded Meat -- Anger as soon as fed is dead -- 'Tis starving makes it fat
There was a time Jeff and Helen loved each other and touched each other's hands and ate breakfast in cafes together and secretly fucked in public, the way people in like do. Then came a time they made each other crazy and beat their hands on steering wheels and tore up love letters and photographs and said goodbye.
Connecting with someone is not necessarily a bond with a significant other, or even a friend, but can be the indefinable - perhaps the rarest and most precious thing in life to find at all.
Proclaim your pride and bitterness loudly to the world, but to me speak softly, and tell me simply that she doesn't love you.
Helplessness and anger make for predictable behavior: Children are certain to shove each other and pull hair, teenagers will call each other names and cry, and grown women who are sisters will say words so cruel that each syllable will take on the form of a snake, although such a snake often circles in on itself to eat its own tail once the words are said aloud.
Theres nothing more efficient than honesty and nothing more powerful than vulnerability because, vulnerability reveals everyone in your life who will abuse power immediately and almost irrevocably.   Theres nothing weaker than hiding your vulnerability because, it means a refusal to stare at those who abuse power and see them for who they are which means they still have power and control over you. Nothing is stronger than vulnerability. Nothing more clarifying. Nothing is clearer than vulnerability, and if you hide who you are you are just making a tombstone of your everyday actions because you dont exist in hiding and you're letting the past rob you.   Exercise the power of vulnerability. When you are vulnerable you are signaling to your system that the past is over and done! That you're no longer a victim! That you're no longer trapped in a destructive and abusive environment! vulnerability means it's over, it's done. The war is over but, if you continue to use the same defenses that you had in the past all you're telling your whole body is that the past is not over.   Be vulnerable. Be honest. Be open and show your heart. That's the best way of telling your heart that the tigers are no longer in the grass. I'm telling you, just take it for a spin. Vulnerability and openness will get you what you want in your life and hiding will only get you the feeling of being prey from here until the end of your life.
Every time you mistreat someone, you reveal the part of you that lacks love and needs to heal.
FRIDA KAHLO TO MARTY MCCONNELL  leaving is not enough; you must stay gone. train your heart like a dog. change the locks even on the house he’s never visited. you lucky, lucky girl. you have an apartment just your size. a bathtub full of tea. a heart the size of Arizona, but not nearly so arid. don’t wish away your cracked past, your crooked toes, your problems are papier mache puppets you made or bought because the vendor at the market was so compelling you just had to have them. you had to have him. and you did. and now you pull down the bridge between your houses, you make him call before he visits, you take a lover for granted, you take a lover who looks at you like maybe you are magic. make the first bottle you consume in this place a relic. place it on whatever altar you fashion with a knife and five cranberries. don’t lose too much weight. stupid girls are always trying to disappear as revenge. and you are not stupid. you loved a man with more hands than a parade of beggars, and here you stand. heart like a four-poster bed. heart like a canvas. heart leaking something so strong they can smell it in the street.
...you do not have too many boogeymen for me. You have just the right number.
There is such a shelter in each other.
Remember, that choosing to stay on the ground is a choice to facilitate a relationship, to honor it. You don't play a game or color a picture with a child to show your superiority. Rather, you choose to limit yourself so as to facilitate and honor that relationship... It is not about winning and losing, but about love and respect.
You can always evaluate a man's character by the way he speaks about his ex girlfriends and other women. When entering a new relationship or getting close with a new guy, make sure you take notice of the language he uses when referring to other girls
I had a dream about you last night... Unfortunately, it wasn't a dream.
The greatest love stories are not those in which love is only spoken, but those in which it is acted upon.
When you can’t reach the standards of another’s heart you must ask yourself,  "What value do I put on my soul that I would subject myself to such rejection?
When you want to share something with another person more than anything, it is one of the most difficult things to realize that you can never have it. Accepting this realization is even more difficult. Loving someone does mean saying goodbye to them in some cases, though we will fight that until the oftentimes bitter end before doing the right thing.
First of all, never buy a man a plasma TV until you're married. A lot of men once they have a plasma TV they don't need a girlfriend
I know you think I'm crazy. Maybe that's because I am. About life, about this moment, about you.
Then, what's the matter?' I wonder, in fact, how many times I have said that or something equal to it to a woman passing palely through my life. <i>What're you thinking? What's made you so quiet? You seem suddenly different. What's the matter?</i> Love <i>me</i> is what this means, of course. Or at least, second best: surrender. Or at the <i>very</i> least, take some time regaling me with why you won't, and maybe by the end you will.
That was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love that does not exist. but darling, You are the only exception
Lovers do things together! They rent videos, they ride Ferris wheels, they go out for pizza, they play Scrabble. They . . . they talk!'  'Talk?' He lifted his head and frowned, his eyes puzzled. 'We talk all the time, Raine. I've never had such talkative sex.'  'That's just it!' She wiggled, flailed, but couldn't budge him. 'Two minutes alone with you, and I'm flat on my back. Every single time!'  A slow, knowing grin spread over his face. 'Is this your way of telling me you want to be on top?
How could I live above the water or breathe under it. How could I swim in darkness consumed in an ocean of you? Falling or flying towards you, losing or finding myself in you and beauty was never the word to catch all that you are. For now I know the means of the infinite and it all starts and ends with you.
If you never left anything or anyone there would be no room for the new. Naturally, to move on is an infidelity -- to others, to the past, to old notions of oneself. Perhaps every day should contain at least one essential infidelity or necessary betrayal. It would be an optimistic, hopeful act, guaranteeing belief in the future -- a declaration that things can be not only different but better.
Lies don't end relationships the truth does.
Bones,” I sighed. “Know something? I’m not afraid of you, but you scare me….” His outline blurred again. “You scare me, too, Kitten,” he might have replied, but I couldn’t be sure.
Just because he likes the same bizzaro crap as you doesn't mean he's your soul mate.
Suddenly I remembered that laugh, it told a different story, our story.
It happens the world over - we love ourselves more than we do the one we say we love. We all want to be Number One, we've got to be Number One or nothing! We can't see that we could make ourselves loved and needed in the Number Two, or Three, or Four spot. No sir, we've got to be Number One, and if we can't make it, we'll rip and tear at the loved one till we've ruined every smidgin of love that was ever there.
The protagonist, Amanda, discusses her sex relationship with her husband, John Paul --  As long as it's done with honesty and grace, John Paul doesn't mind if I go to bed with other men. Or with other girls, as is sometimes my fancy. What has marriage got to do with it? Marriage is not a synonym for monogamy any more than monogamy is a synonym for ideal love. To live lightly on the earth, lovers and families must be more flexible and relaxed. The ritual of sex releases its magic inside or outside the marital bond. I approach that ritual with as much humility as possible and perform it whenever it seems appropriate. As for John Paul and me, a strange spurt of semen is not going to wash our love away.
A relationship needs constant attention. It’s a living thing, not just a habit. You’ve got to keep on top of it.
Every broken heart has screamed at one time or another, "I want to know why!
How can I grieve what is still in motion?" I ask her. "Shoes are still dropping all over the place. I´m not kidding," I say. "It´s Normandy out there.
This is where men and women are different, we can put aside petty competition for relationships - they can't. It interferes.
She realized, when relationships failed to last, it was not because love was no longer present, but because people had stopped believing in themselves and in their partners.
The greater the gap between self perception and reality, the more aggression is unleashed on those who point out the discrepancy.
We Are Lovable  Even if the most important person in your world rejects you, you are still real, and you are still okay.
I could now see her the way she actually is and not in the distorted way my mind presented her to me when I was trying to find a reason to reject her and move on
A horrible end is better than endless horror.
He had known so much about her once -what she thought, how she felt, the reasons for her actions. And now he only knew that he loved her, and all the other knowledge seemed passing from him just as he needed it most.
Did you know that wherever you find fool's gold, real gold exists somewhere nearby? This also goes for relationships and friendships. Real gold is found in the heart. For every piece of fake gold that you discard, remember that true gold isn't too far.
When all one person do is complain, people don't want to talk or listen to them.
I've decided that there isn't much difference in the way we treat our siblings and the way we treat our special someones. But at the end of it all we know our siblings have to forgive us...or they'll never be able to borrow our car.
I had a dream about you. We couldn't decide on a sunrise. You wanted a tan, I only cared about the view. Then World War III fulfilled both our desires.
There are so many movies like this, where you thought you were smarter than the screen but the director was smarter than you, of course he's the one, of course it was a dream, of course she's dead, of course, it's hidden right there, of course it's the truth and you in your seat have failed to notice in the dark.
Every configuration of people is an entirely new universe unto itself.
No people find each other more absurd than lovers
I missed you so much," she breathed. I tilted my head back and put my hands on her shoulders. I could hardly believe this was happening. I was finally getting to touch her. To kiss her. It was all happening. "I missed you, too.
You never walk alone. Even the devil is the lord of flies.
Even before we met and long after we're both gone, my heart lives inside of yours. I'm forever and ever in love with you.
It took hours to turn the clock back 30 seconds.
It seemed that everyone else could mate, could fit their parts together in pleasant and productive ways, but that some almost indistinguishable difference in my anatomy and psyche set me slightly, yet irrevocably, apart.
Too often in my life, love has been defined as "humiliation with occasional roses".
This is what it is to love an artist: The moon is always rising above your house. The houses of your neighbors look dull and lacking in moonlight. But he is always going away from you. Inside his head there is always something more beautiful.
All human males were as fascinated with cars as they were with breasts.
… she gave me a look that deftly combined tenderness with revulsion. To this day the memory of that look still visits me like a Jehovah’s Witness: uninvited and tireless.
the important people in our lives leave imprints. they may die or go in the physical realm, but they are always there in your heart, because they helped form your heart
The fights are always the same
Maybe, if you can't get someone out of your head they were never meant to leave. Perhaps, they were meant to help change you into the person you have been waiting to become.
Maybe what this is. What we have, is something that will save us from ourselves.
To save face, it's better not to ask sex from the ex, but to give everything the axe.
If you don't feel the same way about him, if you're just leading him on, you need to tell him that. I've seen too many nice guys get shafted because a girl can't get over some jerk.
You know what's lame, Pudge? I really care about her. I mean, we were hopeless. Badly matched. But still. I mean, I said I loved her... I mean, it's stupid to miss someone you didn't even get along with. but I don't know, it was nice, you know, having someone you could always fight with.
His arms wrapped around my waist from behind and he kissed my neck again, closer to the wound this time. My pulse accelerated. I wanted him to bite me; I wanted to be his.
As they embrace, she kisses him full on the mouth. And suddenly sticks her tongue right in. She has done this before, often. It’s one of those drunken long shots which just might, at least theoretically, once in ten thousand tries, throw a relationship right out of its orbit and send it whizzing off on another. Do women ever stop trying? No. But, because they never stop, they learn to be good losers.
If you have people who treat you badly in your life, they will be a human shield against people who will treat you well. If that’s not true then we should apply it to marriage and start saying to woman who are being put down or beaten, “you gotta stay with him because he needs you and he has been your husband for 20 years for heaven sakes. You just have to work to love him more and so on.” This is the advice they gave to woman like 200 fucking years ago and it was abusive advice.    I view the parent child relationship (This just not my made up perspective.) it is the least voluntary relationship. At least the woman who got married chose to get married. We don’t choose our parents. The highest standards of behavior are required for parents and no one else. There is no one else whose standards of behavior need be higher than parents and so often parents get away with the lowest possible standards of behavior with regards to their children.
Siguro kaya naimbento ang salita’t konseptong closure ay para sa mga tinatamad malaman ang magiging wakas. Yung mga atat na atat malaman ang ending. Yung mga naburyong na sa pagkainip sa dapat kahinatnan. Kesa nga naman maghintay sa pagkahaba-haba’t pagkatagal-tagal ng ending, mabuti pang putulin nalang.
We can help pave the roads of those around us, but we can't choose their direction.
Successful relationships are those relationships were conflicts are successfully resolved and in fact peoples intimacy, closeness, and love are enhanced through the resolution of conflicts. I have always become closer to my wife and to my friends when we have conflicts and work through them successfully because conflicts will always arise. They are an opportunity for intimacy, self-knowledge, and a greater connection.
I wear a necklace of hope with pearly beads. When I met you, it broke, and the beads spilled all over the floor, into the gutters.
If she does not respect you, she will replace you.
I had a dream about you last night. We moved into a cabin in the countryside. I couldn't handle the spiders. You couldn't handle my drama. I moved back to the city.
I had a dream about you. You suggested to split the profits, so I did. I threw one half in the furnace to power the steam engine, and the other half in the air to distract our pursuers.
I had a dream about you last night. It wasn't until after you sold me the talking car, I realized you were the world’s best ventriloquist.
This is what our love is––a sacred pattern of unbroken unity sewn flawlessly invisible inside all other images, thoughts, smells, and sounds.
Every relationship that has hit a crossroads has asked, “What is it that you want from me?
Il n'y a rien de gentil à laisser de faux espoirs. L'ambiguïté est la source de la douleur.
All over the world major museums have bowed to the influence of Disney and become theme parks in their own right. The past, whether Renaissance Italy or Ancient Egypt, is re-assimilated and homogenized into its most digestible form. Desperate for the new, but disappointed with anything but the familiar, we recolonize past and future. The same trend can be seen in personal relationships, in the way people are expected to package themselves, their emotions and sexuality, in attractive and instantly appealing forms.
Because two people in love don't make a hive mind. Neither should they want to be a hive mind, to think the same, to know the same. It's about being separate and still loving each other, being distinct from each other. One is the violin string one is the bow.
I am replete with stamina in finding out every single fact I can about this whole affair.  Yet, I think, do I want to pull that thread? Do I want to unleash the truth, unravel deceit, and kill reality as I´ve known it? It is irreparable, if I do, from the moment we met until now. It is long. If I discover too much that is false about what I thought my past was, Time will be skewed even further. I already have a poor connection with the present. Example: I have no sense of what day it is. It´s better.
It made me realize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldn't help [...] because sometimes things happen to people and they're not equipped to deal with them.
So I put up with bad behavior in the name of loving the way I thought you were supposed to love.
The toxic behaviors were there before you decided to enter into relationships with them. The signs were there. You may have chosen to look the other way, but the signs were there.—Psychotherapist from Type 1 Sociopath
I just want you to know that where ever life takes you, I'll always be happy for you as long as its something that makes you happy because that's all that really makes me happy. Why? I'm just listening to my heart and all it's telling me is to understand. Which in a way I can but then again I can't. I'm use to it all though because not everyone lives a fair life if you know what I mean.
They ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like smallpox.
Close cycles. Not because of pride or arrogance, but because that no longer fits your life
Let Love Rule
I want to tell him that it's just a stupid car, but bits of me are scattered all over town; the graveyard, school, Cassie's room, the motel, and standing in from of the sink in my mother's kitchen. It takes too much energy to gather all the bits together, so I just sit there and watch him implode.
I kept loving and loving and loving. Every waking hour, I marveled on how these moments would make made me feel. I wanted to love the world and be the change it so deliciously craved.
No one had told her this would happen, that her girlishness would give way to the solid force of wifehood, motherhood. The choices available were all imperfect. If you chose to be with someone, you often wanted to be alone. If you chose to be alone, you often felt the unbearable need for another body - not necessarily for sex, but just to rub your foot, to sit across the table, to drop his things around the room in a way that was maddening but still served as a reminder that he was there.
Nodding, Parker ate. “He’s an exceptional kisser.” “He really is. He . . . How do you know?” When Parker just smiled, Emma’s jaw dropped. “You? You and Jack? When? How?” “I think it’s disgusting,” Mac muttered. “Yet another best pal moving on my imaginary ex.” “Two kisses, my first year at Yale, after we ran into each other at a party and he walked me back to the dorm. It was nice. Very nice. But as exceptional a kisser as he is, it was too much like kissing my brother. And as exceptional a kisser as I am, I believe he felt it was too much like kissing his sister. And that’s how we left it. I gather that wasn’t an issue for you and Jack.
Why?" She asked in a confused whisper. "Out of all the women in the world, why did you choose this mortal?" "Because fate drove me to you.
A balanced inner calmness radiates from a peaceful centre. It neither craves others' approval nor rejects others' presence. It neither pulls towards nor pushes away. It has a reverent attitude towards life and all its inhabitants.
We believe we are seeking happiness in love, but what we are really after is familiarity. We are looking to re-create, within our adult relationships, the very feelings we knew so well in childhood and which were rarely limited to just tenderness and care. The love most of us will have tasted early on came entwined with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent’s warmth or scared of his or her anger, or of not feeling secure enough to communicate our trickier wishes.  How logical, then, that we should as adults find ourselves rejecting certain candidates not because they are wrong but because they are a little too right—in the sense of seeming somehow excessively balanced, mature, understanding, and reliable—given that, in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign and unearnt. We chase after more exciting others, not in the belief that life with them will be more harmonious, but out of an unconscious sense that it will be reassuringly familiar in its patterns of frustration.
We all want relationships that are healthy and resolved, and sometimes that simply doesn't happen. But the beauty of life is that inside these disappointments are hidden the most miraculous of blessings. What we lose and what we might have been pales against what we have.
It’s funny how many ways there are to hurt people. As many ways to hurt as there are species of flower. Whole bouquets of hurt.
It sometimes seemed to him that for love to work, it had to be fair, that he should tell only half the joke, and she the other half. Otherwise, it would not be love, but something completely else–pity or entertainment, or stand-up comedy.
I had a dream about you last night. Eons ago, we created a Universe, then sat back and watched miniature versions of ourselves try to make all the same mistakes we did.
We returned to the hotel and had intercourse. I like that word <i>intercourse</i>. It poses only a limited range of possibilities.
We might have coupled In the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment Or broken flesh with one another At the profane communion table Where wine is spill'd on promiscuous lips  We might have given birth to a butterfly With the daily-news Printed in blood on its wings
Don't show a friend your gift, or your bag of money if you still want to maintain your relationship, but if nay, go on, and all you'll see is hate and jealousy, and you'll fight with him in the street like a dog and all you'll feel is regret.
Use the darkness of your past to propel you to a brighter future.
Men want a girl who looks like a boy. They want to protect her but she must be a survivor. And she must come...like a train...but with...elegance.
It's the opposite of the collapse of the fantasy.  It's what happens when the illusion pales in comparison to the truth. I'm seeing her for the first time. Not Ava Garden Wilder, the rags-to-riches granddaughter of Clyde Jones. Not a tragic, romantic heroine.   Just Ava.  And I am utterly in love.
When introverts go to church, we crave sanctuary in every sense of the word, as we flee from the disorienting distractions of twenty-first-century life. We desire to escape from superficial relationships, trivial communications and the constant noise that pervade our world, and find rest in the probing depths of God's love.
Love affairs are for emotional sprinters; the pleasures of love are for the emotional marathoners.
How could you do that to me?" I repeat. I don´t have to itemize. He knows what I speak of. Eventually N produces three answers, in this order:  1. "Because I am a complete rotter." I silently agree, but it´s a cop-out: <i>I have maggots, therefore I am dead</i>. 2. "I was stressed at work and unhappy and we were always fighting...and you know I was just crazy..."  I cut him off, saying, "You don´t get to be crazy. You did exactly what you chose to do." Which is true, he did. It is what he has always done. He therefore seems slightly puzzled at the need for further diagnosis, which may explain his third response:  3. "I don´t know."  This, I feel instinctively, is the correct answer. How can I stay angry with him for being what he is? I was, after all, his wife, and I chose him. No coincidences, that´s what Freud said. None. Ever. I wipe my eyes on my sleeve and walk toward the truck, saying to his general direction, "Fine. At least now I know: You don´t know." I stop and turn around and fire one more question: a bullet demanding attention in the moment it enters the skin and spreads outward, an important bullet that must be acknowledged. "What did you feel?" After a lengthy pause, he answers. "I felt nothing." And that, I realize too late, was not the whole truth, but was a valid part of the truth. Oh, <i>and welcome to the Serengeti</i>. That too.
I love love. I love having a lover and being one. The insularity of passion. I love it. I love the way it blurs the distinction between everyone who isn't one's lover.
The trouble with you is that the only way you can communicate is through art. You’ve never learned to communicate your feelings to a man. You don’t even want to communicate in a relationship. You think that if you open up to love, you’ll lose your independence or your self-expression or creativity or whatever you call all that passionate, wonderful stuff that makes you feel alive inside.
If truth doesn't set you free, generosity of spirit will.
...Love can give you the most exhilarating wonderful highs at times...  ...Then there will be dives that will take all you have just to hold on...   Quote on the Title Page of "Love TORN Asunder
The vast desire and capacity a woman has for intimate relationships tells us of God's vast desire and capacity for intimate relationships. In fact, this may be The most important thing we ever learn about God--the He yearns for relationship with us. "Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God" (John 17:3). The whole story of the Bible is a love story between God and His people. He yearns for us. He cares. He has a tender heart.
Kiss me hot,heavy,wet &amp; angry with that attitude like you do when your mouth yells it hates me but your tongue screams it can’t wait for me. Hug me, touch me, submit to me with that insatiable passion like you do when you thought you could leave but the sight of my throbbing rock hard love muscle made you too weak in the knees. Your mind is melting fast, your soul is whispering trust, your eyes are begging please and your anger has turned to lust. Let me undress your body, caress your skin and wetly massage your mind back into making love to me again. I’d rather say I’m sorry and keep my best friend than have this come to an end. Be encouraged but more importantly…be lethal with your make up love.
Just friends, just friends. Standing there in the bookstore, watching Seth walk away, I half wondered how anyone could still use that line. But I knew why, of course. It was used because people still believed it. Or at least they wanted to.
I dunno." She sat on the bench and hugged the robe like a pillow. "I still think that Brett guy is cute." "Good luck getting him away from Bekka." Cleo gathered her silky black hair into a high pony and pink-dabbed Smith's Rosebud Salve on her lips. "She's got more grip than Crazy Glue." "More cling than Saran Wrap," Lala added. "More hold than Final Net." Cleo giggled. "More possession than The Exorcist," Lala managed. "More clench than butt cheeks," Blue chimed in. "More competition than American Idol," Frankie stuck out her chest and showed them her diva booty roll. The girls burst out laughing. "Nice!" Blue lifted her purple gloved hand. Frankie slapped it without a single spark. "I hate to be a downer..." Claudine shuffled back into the conversation wearing her slippers and robe. "But that girl will destroy you if she catches you with Brett." "I'm not worried," Frankie tossed her hair back. "I've seen all the teen movies, and the nice girl gets the boy in the end.
Somewhere underneath it all, I know he doesn't deserve to take up space in my brain.
Yes. THANK YOU. And say hello to Judas Iscariot.
Unfortunately, he still hadn’t asked for my number, or a date, or my hand in marriage, and my drink was getting low.
Because that's what unfaithfulness is, isn't it? A cancer that's always there in the back of your mind, eating away at the foundations of the relationship.
My life was dark, torture and empty before you found me. You brought the light, Red. I love you.
When you depersonalize abrasive behavior and see it as a call for help you become a catalyst for the best kind of change.
When a clandestine couple kisses, it is much more likely that sex will immediately follow. This is because there is much more risk. Once you have kissed secretly, it is very difficult not to have sex. It would be impolite not to have sex. You have to show that you are serious about each other.
I saw my reflection in their eyes, but not the men themselves, not clearly. This preserved the idea that all intelligent and even vaguely attractive men were essentially good. Delusion detest focus and romance provides the veil.
My Personality  unfolding before you like a Swiss Army knife.
Oh, how wonderfully romantic of you. Romantics are really only in love with themselves.
I didn’t answer. We were not buddies. We could not chat about the proximity of our offices, or football, or forgiveness.
So often, we had the tendency of saying, they're the problem. No, they're not the problem. Our heart is the problem. they are just there to show me what is in my heart. They don't put those things in my heart. They don't put the wrath, the bitterness in my heart. Those things are already there. They are the vessels God uses to to release what is in my heart so that I am aware of how black my heart really is.
There are many things that can keep you in a relationship. Fear of being alone, Fear of disrupting the arrangement of your life.A decision to settle for something that's okay. Because you don;t know if you can get any better. Or maybe there's the irrational belief that it will get better even if you know he won't change.
I’ve loved him since I’ve known him, Mrs. Daniels. He just finally stopped fighting.
I had a dream about you last night... You replaced all the people in your life with kittens. It felt more like a prediction of the future.
I had a dream about you last night... you sat in a cardboard box and said you were a tree.
I had a dream about you last night… it was raining and you were fishing for fire to set a sandcastle a flame.
I had a dream about you last night... you were crying over spilt ink screaming "the words, the what could have been beautiful words.
I had a dream about you last night.. You pretended not to be a three hole punch.
I no longer have the energy for meaningless friendships, forced interactions or unnecessary conversations. If we don’t vibrate on the same frequency there’s just no reason for us to waste our time. I’d rather have no one and wait for substance than to not feel someone and fake the funk.
I believe the world is divided in three groups: givers, takers and the few that can balance both impulses. Giving and loving is a beautiful thing. It is the currency of compassion and kindness, it is what separates good people from the rest. And without it, the world would be a bleak place. If you are a giver, it is wise to define your boundaries because takers will take what you allow them to; all givers must learn to protect that about themselves or eventually, there is nothing left to give.
I am unlovable...I have tried to involve myself in other people, in relationships, and even - in my sillier moments - in love. But it doesn't work. Something in me is broken or missing and sooner or later the other person catches me Acting or one of Those Nights comes along.
There are many forms of love as there is moments in time, and you are capable of feeling them all at different stages of your life.
There are better people in the world, do not let the worst do the worst to you, you deserve the best in life.
Each time a person passes by you and you say 'hello', imagine that person turning into a candle. The more positivity, love and light you reflect, the more light is mirrored your way. Sharing beautiful hellos is the quickest way to earn spiritual brownie points. You should start seeing hellos as small declarations of faith. Every time you say hello to a stranger, your heart acknowledges over and over again that we are all family.
Honey, nobody ever knows someone completely. You have to just enjoy what you do know and have faith in the rest.
Our actions are guaranteed to affect others. Because we are not alone in this world, much of our learning about ourselves comes from our interaction with others. Our relationships are our teachers. We learn from each other.
But everything I have to give, I'll give to you
she was completely whole and yet never fully complete
To get the most out of the relationship you are in, it won't be helpful to listen to the ego's stories about it. They will only bring separation and conflict. Essence would tell a different story about your loved one. It would probably be something like: "This person is in my life for me to love to the best of my ability. Let's see what happens if I do that." As Essence, we are here to serve others and serve life. The ego, on the other hand, is all about serving itself.
The person who wants out of the relationship always gets her way.
I just wouldn’t want to hook up with a guy unless I really, really like him, and in my experience all boys can be classified as either assholes or bores, unless they’re both. Maybe it’s a blessing, because the last thing I need is relationship drama to sidetrack me from my grades.
I want to take all our best moments, put them in a jar, and take them out like cookies and savor each one of them forever.
The first time someone I loved left me behind...I didn't know how my family would balance. We had been such a sturdy little end table, four solid legs. I was sure we would now be off-kilter, always unstable. Until one day I looked more closely, and realized that we had simply become a stool.
Love doesn't always curl your toes sometimes it takes a bite right out of your soul.
She was aware that in love even the most passionate idealism will not rid the body's surface of its terrible, basic importance.
Because a quiet night is not the same as a silent one, a firm man is not the same as a steady one, and a bright light is not the same as a brilliant one.
Excuse me, I feel interrupted and I think I've overdose from the idea of loving you.
You cannot borrow half of who you are from someone else, yet people try to do it all of the time, they just call it a relationship!
She would be quiet at first. Then she would say a word about something small, something she had noticed, and then another word, and another, each one flung out like a little piece of sand, one from this direction, another form behind, more and more, until his looks, his character, his soul would have eroded away . . . I was afraid that some unseen speck of truth would fly into my eye, blur what I was seeing and transform him from the divine man I thought he was into someone quite mundane, mortally wounded with tiresome habits and irritating imperfections.
Marriage," she said quietly, "is the most expensive ticket to nowhere
Do you really think that I don’t have anything better to do than to spend my time thinking about you? Digging up a little of the goods on Luc Martineau?” Fine lines appeared at the corners of his eyes and he laughed. “Sweetheart, there is nothing little about Luc’s goods.
The time to read Madame Bovary is when your romantic hopes and desires have crashed, and you will believe that your future relationships will have disappointing - even devastating - consequences.
Sanity is not about confrontation. It's about filtering. Having a stable and happy life is about saying "no" to crazy people, not about inviting them in and then hoping that confrontations are going to make them sane.
Because conflict-avoidant Emily would never “bite” or even hiss unless Greg had done something truly horrible, on some level she processes his bite to mean that she’s terribly guilty—of something, anything, who knows what?
To be yourself is in many ways to be inconvenient to others. Only placaters and appeasers get along with other people all the time and that's not really getting along with anyone. That's just self erasure.
The three most important words in a relationship are not, 'I love you,' but, 'Tell me more.
I had a dream about you last night... shortly after I woke up screaming in terror.
I had a dream about you last night... you made a beard for yourself out of forty two bags of Twizzlers.
Don’t ever stray from yourself, in order to be close to someone that doesn’t have the courtesy to remind you of your worth, or the integrity of a gentleman to walk you home.
It was the wildness of it that got me going: the primal lust, the sheer needs of two people in heat, quickly finding ways to express their sacred hunger to each other in animal passion.
The power of patriarchy has been to make maleness feared and to make men feel that it is better to be feared that to be loved. Whether they can confess this or not, men know that just is not true.
I have always wanted to give you the world, so I started giving you pieces of the oceans that kept us apart.
The more invested I am in my own ideas about reality, the more those experiences will feel like victimizations rather than the ups and downs of relating. Actually, I believe that the less I conceptualize things that way, the more likely it is that people will want to stay by me, because they will not feel burdened, consciously or unconsciously, by my projections, judgments, entitlements, or unrealistic expectations.
Broken hearts, you can run, you can hide and perhaps the earth is big enough to believe you’re safe. So maybe for a moment you have escaped but hear me, hear me well. Love will find you and it will leave nothing behind.
The greatest adventure is to have no fear for the blaze that lies ahead.
There is a correlation between the number of days since a man last had sex, and, the number of things that he is willing to do for a woman.
<i>'Better to have loved and lost,' my ass.</i>  Anyone parroting that little platitude had obviously never lost anyone of consequence.
We’re only instruments of love, flowing through heaps of pain hoping one day we’d hatch a passion of our own.
how anxiously I yearned for those I had forsaken.
Commitment is another name for relationship not the compromise.
Miles was still mourning the loss of his Romantic Plan. 'There was going to be champagne, and oysters, and you' -- he held out both hands as though shifting a piece of furniture -- 'were going to be sitting there, and I was going to get down on one knee, and...and...
If someone tries to use you as a tool, you shouldn't mind it, because it is their choice and folly, not yours.
But sometimes this hatred broke like a wave, unexplainably collapsing under its own weight, and before it would begin to well up again, she suddenly felt nothing but pure compassion for him, a kindness and forgiveness that almost broke her heart.
First impressions are rarely worth preserving. Men typically fall short of our expectations.
Give people time. Give people space. Don’t beg anyone to stay. Let them roam. What’s meant for you will always be yours.
You'll need courage because polyamorous relationships can be scary. Loving other people without a script is scary. Allowing the people you love to make their own choices without controlling them is scary. The kind of courage we're talking about involves being willing to let go of guarantees - and love and trust your partners anyway.
Far from a normal-functioning relationship, but normal has never been our thing.
Some people have the coldest smiles, but have the tenderest hearts. And many have the most tender smiles, but carry the coldest hearts. You cannot judge a man by his smile, but you can judge a man by his heart. The smallest actions reveal the most about a hearts true color, so pay attention to them. Actions are the true words of the heart.
Falling in love is a wonderfully terrifying sensation.
It was some time since I had gone to sleep in the same room with a girl. Of course, the room was large and reasonably well-lighted, and the girl had other things than me on her mind.
She didn't want me; she wanted all of me. I didn't mind saying it. My girlfriend scared the crap out of me.
well I believe in commitment it's just I, you know, I don't stick to it.
Sports bars are also a great place for guys to meet other guys--either for sex or for wrestling, whichever feels more right.
When it comes to sex: some men treat women as objects; some women treat objects as men.
Whatever it is that makes closeness possible between people also puts them in the way of hard feelings if that closeness ends.
In every one of the Greeks' mythology tales, there is this: a man chasing a woman, or a woman chasing a man. There is never a meeting in the middle.
And if insight were sufficient, if the inner life were the whole of life, their happiness has been assured.
That feeling you get when you want to tell some one you love them, and there is no one there..
Love is fickle and fleeting," Tsukiko continues. "It is rarely a solid foundation for decisions to be made upon, in any game.
people will forget what you said, people will forget what you do, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
The girls said she was too cynical about love, but how could you not be? On the surface, relations between men and women were all soft kisses and white gowns and hand-holding. But underneath they were a scary, complicated, ugly mess, just waiting to rise to the surface.
Psychoanalysis is often about turning our ghosts into ancestors, even for patients who have not lost loved ones to death. We are often haunted by important relationships from the past that influence us unconsciously in the present. As we work them through, they go from haunting us to becoming simply part of our history.
I have to figure out why I worked at a job I hated for years. I have to find out why I can’t see what everyone else sees in me. I don’t feel beautiful. When I look in the mirror, I never saw beautiful. For this to happen to someone like me, it’s devastating, Jonas. I don’t want you to think it’s vanity, it isn’t. I can’t see me and I need to be able to do that. I need to find out what I’m like and what I want. I have to be comfortable in my own skin before I can be in a relationship the way you want.
Real relationships - the kind that were supposed to last but never did - were more trouble than they were worth.
Fletcher was always going to be your ex-boyfriend, from the moment you met him. He's just finally caught up with where he's supposed to be.
You had to live in your own bubble. You couldn't force your way into someone else's, because then it wouldn't be a bubble any more.
It is assured that men of all ages imagine a woman naked when they first meet.
He opened his mouth to say that she looked extremely beautiful and deserved armfuls of roses, but the words were lost in committee somewhere, shuffled aside by the parts of his head that worked full-time at avoiding ridicule.
For the first time in history, middle-class women do not need men in the traditional ways - for safety, for money, for a life. So they’re demanding instead what they always wanted but couldn’t ask for: emotional connection, presence, intimacy. Sex with enough foreplay, enough seduction, enough closeness to please them. Men are baffled not only because the needs they are being asked to fill differ so from what their fathers and grandfathers understood to be their jobs but also because full-fledged intimacy requires strengths and skills they’ve never learned. Moreover… they’re strengths and skills that were once left solely to women: Men didn’t have to develop them. This maturational mismatch may be contributing to distrust among lovers of all ages.
One minute she acts like she wants to be with me and I'm the one rejecting her. The next, she's got this barbed wire fence and barking dogs around her, like I can't even ask her the simplest questions."  "And here I was assuming you didn't care about her."  Stabbing his fingers through his hair, he groaned, "I don't!"  "And you make it perfectly clear." Men. Idiots.
He reached out and intertwined our hands. Gently urging me forward he whispered, “Have I lost you love?
Technically, on the spectrum of very bad things, they did nothing truly wicked. But of course, that spectrum has no measure for the greatest of all carnal sins, the kind that occurs before skin touches skin, before wondering turns to yearning, yearning to having, having to holding for dear life, when two people cling to each other so desperately that even when they lie, inches apart, neither is fully satisfied until the light between them turns to darkness.
None of us, irrespective of our sexual preference and/or practice, imagine that we can have an intimate relationship with a partner and always have seamless harmony. Indeed, most of us assume that once the “honeymoon” period is over differences will emerge and conflicts will happen. Positively, we also assume that we will be “safe“ in those moments; that even if voices are raised and emotions expressed are intense, there will not be and should not be any abuse or any reason to be unsafe, and that the will to connect and communicate will prevail.
Relationship doesn’t remain, We resonate on different flames, I could cut you down again, If you were like all other men, If you were like all other men, I know that I could shut you down again
I'm always looking for meaningful one-night stands
Sing me a love song in a slow, southern drawl to the tune of sunny days...
North is a powerful man, and you're still connected to him." Flo frowned. "Probably sexual memory, those Capricorns are insatiable. Well, you know. Sea Goat. And of course, you're a Fish. You'll end up back in bed with him."  Andie slammed the car door. "You know what I'd like for Christmas, Flo? Boundaries. You can gift me early if you'd like.
Deep down under where his heart resided, strangled up in thorny vines of guilt, anger, fear and longing, there lay something deeper in him, something that he couldn’t see but she could.
I could probably write a book on the complexities of our relationship, on my constantly shifting emotions, my ever-changing mind, but let's just say that nothing is ever as black and white as it seems, that love is not only blind but pathetic too. It can make us into victims and fools, reduce us to the kind of people who infuriate us on soap operas, the kind you want to scream at for allowing the creep or bitch to walk all over them.
Married women are far more depressed than married men -- in unhappy marriages, three times more; and -- interestingly -- in happy marriages, five times more. In truth, it is men who are thriving in marriage, now as always, and who show symptoms of psychological and physical distress outside it. Not only their emotional well-being but their very lives, some studies say, depend on being married!
So many men treat their wives badly, or indifferently, or with barely contained impatience. Josh doesn't mind-- no that's not right--he insists on openly showing his love and respect for me.
We're broken in complementary ways, thus rendering our damage comprehensible to each other.
The books we love offer a sketch of a whole universe that we secretly inhabit, and in which we desire the other person to assume a role.  One of the conditions of happy romantic compatibility is, if not to have read the same books, to have read at least some books in common with the other person—which means, moreover, to have non-read the same books. From the beginning of the relationship, then, it is crucial to show that we can match the expectations of our beloved by making him or her sense the proximity of our inner libraries.
Mend your speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes.
The Betty Lady explains love and splitting up: "It´s like playing the shell game with Jesus. You can´t figure anything out; it´s best not to try. You´ll just humiliate yourself.
(Georgie) Why is it that you always want to run after the one that goes off in a huff, and push away the one who is clinging to you?
This is the whole stupid thing about all these unblood relationships. They depend on people staying the same, standing in the same spot they were in over a decade ago, when they first met. Surely the reality is that connections between people aren't permanent, but fleeting and random, like a solar eclipse or clouds meeting in the sky. They exist in a constantly moving universe full of constantly moving objects.
We played for about half an hour before I realized we were actually playing two different games. What I’d thought of as ludo was actually a game called gin rummy, and what Warren was playing seemed to be a mixture of craps and table tennis. Once we started playing by one consistent set of rules, though, the fun was really over.
A man must at times be hard as nails: willing to face up to the truth about himself, and about the woman he loves, refusing compromise when compromise is wrong. But he must also be tender. No weapon will breach the armor of a woman's resentment like tenderness.
Men, you'll never be a good groom to your wife unless you're first a good bride to Jesus.
Listen she said, everything ends, every single relationship you will ever have in your lifetime is going to end.... I'll die, you'll die, you'll get tired of each other. You don't always know how it's going to happen, but it is always going to happen. So stop trying to make everything permanent, it doesn't work. I want you to go out there and find some nice man you have no intention of spending the rest of your life with. You can be very, very happy with people you aren't going to marry.
There comes a time in some relationships when no matter how sincere the attempt to reconcile the differences or how strong the wish to recreate a part of the past once shared, the struggle becomes so painful that nothing else is felt and the world and all its beauty only add to the discomfort by providing cruel contrast.
I hold a strict policy of automatic grudges against people everyone likes.
It is a matter of perspective, the difference between opponent and partner," Tsukiko says. "You step to the side and the same person can be either or both or something else entirely. It is difficult to know which face is true.
I didn't want to leave things the way we had, unresolved, ... and tried to tell myself he cared about me enough not to look elsewhere for what I wasn't giving him.
He offered her power, money, status... a giant prison, all in exchange  for only...her soul.
To love is to soar in the wild unexpectedly.
Ideally, of course, a relationship is best, but then how many people are capable of deep feeling? Practically none.
To the degree you experience God's love towards you - seeing you as beautiful and radiant - to that degree sex won't ruin your life.
So she stood naked in front of the young man and at this moment stopped playing the game.
Women get into a relationship hoping a man will change, and he never does; men get into a relationship hoping the woman don't change, but she always does. Men want their partners to be consistent. That they won't make impromptu impossible demands nor baffle him with classically female sudden-onset hysterical behavior.
He found it both sad and fascinating that only through an artificial universe of video images could she establish contact with the real world.
You know it’s a bad sign when the theme song from Titanic describes your relationship.
The conventional parabola--sentiment, the touch of the hand, the kiss, the passionate kiss, the feel of the body, the climax in the bed, then more bed, then less bed, then the boredom, the tears and the final bitterness--was to him shameful and hypocritical.
A man to whom a woman cannot look up, she cannot love. Yet, it is marvelous how a woman contrives to find something to look up to in a man.
By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.
The thing about her is, she’s good-natured. He knew it the second he saw her standing by the parking meters. He could just tell from the soft way her belly looked. With women, you keep bumping against them, because they want different things, they’re a different race. Either they give, like a plant, or scrape, like a stone. In all the green world nothing feels as good as a woman’s good nature.
As I’ve said, it wasn’t until a long time afterwards—long after I’d left the Cottages—that I realized just how significant out little encounter in the churchyard had been. I was upset at the time, yes. But I didn’t believe it to be anything so different from other tiffs we’d had. It never occurred to me that our lives, until then so closely interwoven could unravel and separate over a thing like that. But the fact was, I suppose, there were powerful tides tugging us apart by then, and it only needed something like that to finish the task. If we’d understood that back then—who knows?—maybe we’d have kept a tighter hold of one another.
for to have a deep attachment for a person (or a place or thing) is to have taken them as the terminating object of our instinctual responses." Separation anxiety. International Journal of Psycho-Analysts, XLI, 1-25 (1959(
Pull a thread in my story and feel the tremor half a world and two millenia away.
Ah, sweetie. If the poets couldn’t unriddle them, then you certainly can’t. Be kind, and keep your ears on offer if she wants to talk. But you can’t draw out the strangeness, Edgar. It’s not a poison.
When a man I like touches my arm or my hair, I want to know if he'll touch the center of me, and whatever I learned in school--I went to school for a long time--I seem to believe that my center can be reached best with the tip of a penis....
Between Countess Nordston and Levin there had been established those relations, not infrequent in society, in which two persons, while ostensibly remaining on friendly terms, are contemptuous of each other to such a degree that they cannot even treat each other seriously and cannot even insult each one another.
I wanted intimacy in caps lock but I got it in parentheses. We curled into each other, upside down, my empty spaces filled by another. "Give me the three minute version of your life story," he said. I nailed it it one then refused to throw the question back as etiquette governs. He wanted to know where I'd been. I wanted to know who he was.
I wonder if you ever read my poems and wish  they were written for you.
I review what I know once again, confronting the monolith now alien and almost unconnected to me: my marriage.
That's the problem with relationships," George was saying. "It's a contract. You agree to be some unchanging caricature of yourself. To act the same way all the time. Never to change. It's counter-evolutionary. How can anything new and good come into your life, if you're holding on to something that doesn't exist anymore?
When coming to sex: First served, first come.
Anxiety and desire are two, often conflicting, orientations to the unknown. Both are tilted toward the future. Desire implies a willingness, or a need, to engage this unknown, while anxiety suggests a fear of it. Desire takes one out of oneself, into the possibility or relationship, but it also takes one deeper into oneself. Anxiety turns one back on oneself, but only onto the self that is already known.
He educated Maurice, or rather his spirit educated Maurice's spirit, for they themselves became equal. Neither thought "Am I led; am I leading?" Love had caught him out of triviality and Maurice out of bewilderment in order that two imperfect souls might touch perfection.
At least there's nothing scary about him and hopefully he doesn't see anything scary in me. We go way back, to summer camp. We KNOW each other. People I don't know just make me want to say YIKES! I'll take history over mystery any day of the week.
Do you love me Hero?" His pale green eyes were full of torment. "Do you love me like I love you?
<b>The only person that should wear your ring is the one person that would never…</b>  1.	Ask you to remain silent and look the other way while they hurt another. 2.

My boyfriends have all been as stoical as queen's guards. They'd been patient, committed, and dispassionate, and I'd had to really debase myself to extract any emotion, either grin or grimace, from them.
With him everything is a test, affection is measured, that given weighed against that which has been received, and the balance, more often than not, disappointing him.
Small animals are a great problem. I wish God had never created small animals, or else that He had made them so they could talk, or else that He'd given them better faces. Space. Take moths. They fly at the lamp and burn themsleves, and then they fly right back again. It can't be instinct, because it isn't the way it works. They just don't understand, so they go right on doing it. Then they lie on their backs and all their legs quiver, and then they're dead. Did you get all that? Does it sound good?" "Very good," Grandmother said. Sophia stood up and shouted, "Say this: say I hate everything that dies slow! Say I hate everything that won't let you help! Did you write that?
Then, whenever I feel the sun on my face, I will think of you, " I told him. "You will always be with me, Bill. Because of all I have felt for you, and all I have learned from you.
However self-sufficient we may fancy ourselves, we exist only in relation -- to our friend, family, and life partners; to those we teach and mentor; to our co-workers, neighbors, strangers; and even to forces we cannot fully conceive of, let alone define. In many ways, we are our relationships.
The clerk is looking at me. His expression hasn't changed. What I want to do is punch a hole in the front of the desk, reach through, grab his balls, and make him sing The Mickey Mouse Club song. But these days, I'm working on the theory that killing everyone I don't like might be counterproductive. I'm learning to use my indoor voice like a big boy, so I smile back at the clerk.
I have to wonder if you're not being slightly naive here. I mean, are you saying that you want nothing for people? You have no motives? Everybody has motives. Name the person, the circumstances, I'll name the motive. Even saints have motives -- to feel like saints, probably. ... But still, the point of any relationship is obtaining something from another person.
Ladies! I encourage you NOT to be so easily flattered by what a man has. Be flattered by his strength, courage, integrity, and character as a man. Be impressed by his ability to be honest, faithful, loving, and respectful to you. Be impressed because he can communicate and openly express his feelings. Be impressed because he’s got confidence, direction, and purpose in his life. Be impressed because he’s a quality man, NOT a fine man. Real Talk!
their respect for the mystery--the half-grasped but never spoken idea that maybe, when you got right down to the place where the cheese binds, there is no such <i>thing</i> as marriage, no such thing as union, that each soul stood alone and ultimately defied rationality. That was the mystery.
Is disinterest not the essence of every human relationship?
Real relationships are the product of time spent, which is why so many of us have so few of them.
That cake tasted good. But the cake in the garbage tasted better. It was the best cake I ever ate.
I can only do what's easy. I can only entice and be enticed. I can't, and won't, attempt difficult relations. If I marry it will either be a man who's strong enough to boss me or whom I'm strong enough to boss. So I shan't ever marry, for there aren't such men. And Heaven help any one whom I do marry, for I shall certainly run away from him before you can say 'Jack Robinson.
Women have been brought up with the false sense that they have all the options in the world. We don’t understand that the culture really isn’t offering us all of these options – there still are very strong pressures to conform. We have to step outside the culture to be able to make choices that will really give us what we want. But we lack the psychic mechanisms to do this, to really choose.
Kate lost a mother," I said, "but I lost a nothing." Kate doesn't feel that way," Jack assured me. But what about everybody else besides Kate? How can I ever explain to anyone what she was when she and I had no name? People need names for everything. I wasn't a relative or a friend, I was just an object of her kindness." He wiped my cheeks, saying <i>Ssshh</i>. I buried my face in his shoulder. True kindness is stabilizing," I went on. "When you feel it and when you express it, it becomes the whole meaning of things. Like all there is to achieve. It's life, demystified. A place out of self, a network of simple pleasures, not a waltz, but like whirls within a waltz." You're the one now," Jack said definitively. "That's why you met her. She had something she had to pass on." (p. 95)
As I walked inside, she turned around and headed for the end of the bed. Then she paused and turned to face me. She was wearing her Orchard Hill basketball T-shirt and sweatpants and she looked tired, but beautiful.
She understands suddenly that the stuff that fills her up is not the love or attention she might get from other people; it is the love she herself has for other people. We are, Portia decides, the people we love
You want him praising the Lord in the morning, you put a smile on his face tonight.
Bravery is the choice to show up and listen to another person, be it a loved one or perceived foe, even when it is uncomfortable, painful, or the last thing you want to do.
A girl should set her sights on a man who has money; or if not, who can expect to come into money; or if not, who has moneyed connections.
(Peter) If you don't share the lows, it seems you might stop sharing the highs as well.
There is tremendous trauma in the betrayal caused by a perpetual liar as they repeatedly commit psychological abuse.
Breaking the circle”  My eyes darken when I see my new lover. Fresh prey. My body doesn’t really react in a sexual way. It’s the devil inside me that celebrates next conquest. We exchange meaningless sweet words. His hungry gaze penetrates my breasts and ass. Another drink and laughter. And then another one. Sometimes I get very drunk or high. And then I don’t feel him between my legs. I don’t see his sweating face. I don’t hear his moans and questions if I came. I can’t stay sober when I cheat on you. I’m such a coward that I can’t even face this inner monster. It consumes me, it takes away my dignity.  It makes me do horrible things. It hurts you, the only one who ever loved me. Who knows what I really am. No. It’s not the monster. It’s me. I am the whore. I dig my nails into your soft flesh until it bleeds. I am the one pushing you away, feasting on your kindness.  I blame those hard punches of my past for my infidelity.  Those cruel hands. Those hateful words.  I try not to, I really do.  I try to be a better person. But how can I if I am just nobody? You know why I leave. Yet you stay. You’re there when I’m back. With your sorrow and cry and resentment and wrath. Why? If I’m broken because of my pain what’s your excuse? Why do you keep letting me treat you like a stray dog? Don’t you have any respect for yourself? What the fuck is wrong with you? And just when I think I have my own slave for life you break the circle.  You shut the door with a grimace of relief. You can’t look at me anymore.  See, you’re finally free! My inner innocent girl is happy for you.  But the monster inside kicks and laughs at me. I’m left alone. I dress up and go hunting.
When someone you love makes compassion, kindness, forgiveness, respect and God an option, you can be sure they have made you an option, as well.
My God, these folks don't know how to love -- that's why they love so easily.
Men are not dogs. We merely think we are and, on occasion, act as if we are. But, by believing in our nobler nature, women have the amazing power to inspire us to live up to it.
Women rescue men just as much as, if not more than, men rescue women.
If you expect honesty, be honest. If you expect forgiveness, forgive. If you expect a whole person, you have to be a whole person.
It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted.
Perhaps the depth of love can be calibrated by the number of different selves that are actively involved in a given relationship.
people have character strength but they lack communication skills, and that undoubtedly affects the quality of relationships as well.
Our moments are music, and sometimes – just sometimes – we can catch them and put them into some lasting form. If we didn’t have music, I don’t think we could ever be truly happy, and if we didn’t have special moments, we would never find music.
These guys may not talk too much about relationships, but they sure do blush at telling moments, don’t they? Maybe that’s the key to understanding the opposite sex; I could invent a science, call it blushology.
What? Did we end up hating each other? Did we end up the way we thought we always knew would? Did I end up wearing khakis because of that fucking ad?
First she would try to kill him, but failing this give him food and her body, breast-feed him back to a state of childishness and even, perhaps, feel affection for him. Then, the moment he was asleep, cut his throat. The synopsis of the ideal marriage.
It all comes down to that one person you always think about before you fall asleep at night. And text "Good Morning" as soon as you wake up.
The women we really love are the women who complete us, who have the qualities we can borrow and so become something nearer to whole men. Just as we complete them, of course; it’s not a one-way thing. Leola and I, when romance was stripped away, were too much alike; our strengths and weaknesses were too nearly the same. Together we would have doubled our gains and our losses, but that isn’t what love is.
He is not the same person as when we met, but . . . neither am I. Time has refined us, but instead of pushing us apart, we’re closer than ever.
Regardless of whether a relationship brings us joy or sorrow, each relationship gives us the opportunity to grow stronger, nobler, and more compassionate with ourselves and others.
I arrived, I saw humans and I saw through their faces. Nothing ever changes but the light in their eyes. For I too have buried my demons today, without knowing what might remain beneath the face of tomorrow.
Never give a lousy person the opportunity to create lousy babies.
To share out your soul freely, that is what metanoia (a change of mind, or repentance)really refers to: a mental product of love. A change of mind, or love for the undemonstrable. And you throw off every conceptual cloak of self-defense, you give up the fleshly resistance of your ego. Repentance has nothing to do with self-regarding sorrow for legal transgressions. It is an ecstatic erotic self-emptying. A change of mind about the mode of thinking and being.
Love is more about being the right person than finding the right person.
I thought I would prefer apathy over this," I confided to her. "Why?" she asked. "Are you saying you would rather be cold than comforted? He's looking at you and offering his hand in friendship and you're rudely looking away pretending not to notice. At least with him you wouldn't be so alone." I felt my eyes turn into colorless pools as I glared at her for stating the obvious. "Being numb to someone is better than feeling something," I explained. "Safer you mean," she interrupted. I sighed and continued, "When someone who was once significant in your life comes back after an extended absence, emotions you had finally freed yourself from are reawakened, and if that's not enough to contend with, dormant memories are summoned whether you want them to be or not." "And what is it that you want?" she posed triumphantly. I swallowed my anger and thought with defeat, "Nothing anyone can give me.
Your relationships will take you beyond the boundaries of your normal strength. Encouragement gives struggling people eyes to see the unseen Christ.
Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home.
I wept for relationships not possible due to denial and dreams locked in the back of people’s minds, all of the bits of life that lay dormant until the babblings of televisions and nursing homes sweep them away. It makes me wonder how many of the dreams we had originally have already been forgotten.
You can never recover from losing a person you love, but you can find a way to let it be part of your life rather than letting it take over every part of you
I help others because I can, not because I expect something in return.
What I want to impart through our correspondence is that no matter what anyone may be going through, here's the thing: If you love each other, and if your relationship is worth the pain or the hardship, stay with it. The extraordinary treasure of sharing another person's life is one of the most gratifying experiences of being a human being.
Robots are like Mars: they need girls.  Boys won't do; the memesoup is all wrong. They stomp when they should kiss and they're none too keen on having things shoved inside them...  It's not a robot until you put a girl inside. Sometimes  I feel like that.  A junkyard  the Company forgot to put a girl in.
When clouds of pain loom in the sky When a shadow of sadness flickers by When a tear finds its way to the eye When fear keeps the loneliness alive I try and console my heart Why is it that you cry? I ask  This is only what life imparts These deep silences within Have been handed out to all by time Everyone’s story has a little sorrow Everyone’s share has a little sunshine  No need for water in your eyes Every moment can be a new life Why do you let them pass you by? Oh heart, why is it that you cry?
The thing that binds us together is that we have both lowered our expectations of life
About halfway through I broke down crying, which I hadn't expected. I was a little ashamed, but only a little;it was her, you see, and she never taxed me with the times that I slipped from the way I thought a man should be...the way I thought I should be, at any rate. A man with a good wife is the luckiest of God's creatures, and one without must be among the most miserable, I think, the only true blessing of their lives that they don't know how poorly off they are.
Relationships are never static. They have to evolve over time as the individuals in them change.
Christopher McCandless:"I will miss you too, but you are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from the joy of human relationships. God's place is all around us, it is in everything and in anything we can experience. People just need to change the way they look at things.
When women are secret they are secret indeed; and more often then not they only begin to be secret with the advent of a second lover.
Because that’s what unfaithfulness is, isn’t it? A cancer that’s always there in the back of your mind, eating away at the foundations of the relationship. It’s happened once, it could happen again, so you’re always looking for telltale signs or symptoms to show that it’s reappeared...
We spend so much time on the whole world instead of on those who really need us, in a world where rumours are a trend and truth is an afterthought.
I know my vision is impaired and cannot be trusted with even the simplest tasks, much less dating. Not that I´ve come within talon distance of a man.
Walk together. Feel the heart beats. Experience the presence. This is how to be thankful.
No relationship is without its difficulties and this is certainly true when one or both of the persons involved has an autistic spectrum disorder. Even so, I believe what is truly essential to the success of any relationship is not so much compatibility, but love. When you love someone, virtually anything is possible.
An apple tree is just like a person. In order to thrive, it needs companionship that's similar to it in some ways, but quite different than others.
Nurturing, Providing, and loving you passionately. May that be, my number of responsibilities. As one to the end, forever more. That's how long I desire, our love to last for. Providing for you many and joyful memories. In hours of darkness, as well as brightness. I plan to supply for you. For your love for me and happiness, is all that matters to me.
How much do you love me?" She drew in a breath and let it out. "Too much." "Too much is just enough for this man." "And do you love me?" she whispered. "I have always loved you. Always. You know that.
It's early days. A few skeletons are bound to keep jumping out of the closet.
Beauty is in the heart of the beholder.
When I am lonely for boys what I miss is their bodies. The smell of their skin, its saltiness. The rough whisper of stubble against my cheek. The strong firm hands, the way they rest on the curve of my back.
Some women do not masturbate for pleasure; they masturbate to make a political statement: to remind us that women do not really need men (or at least not as much and as frequently as every single male chauvinist and every single misogynist believes).
I´ve blown it, the whole grisly charade.
I shall never cease to marvel at the way we beg for love and tyranny.
Quand on parle des vices d’un homme, si on vous dit : “Tout le monde le dit” ne le croyez pas ; si l’on parle de ses vertus en vous disant encore : “Tout le monde le dit”, croyez-le.
He did not want an affair with his boss. He did not even want a one-night stand. Because what always happened was that people found out, gossip at the water cooler, meaningful looks in the hallway. And sooner or later the spouses found out. It always happened. Slammed doors, divorce lawyers, child custody.
When she had failed once or twice to respond to some conversational gambit or other, Bond also relapsed into silence and occupied himself with his own gloomy thoughts.
Be careful… not all are what they seem. Some people pretend to be the beach, but they’re actually quicksand.
But my best friend from college was silent for a long time. She, of all of my friends, had seen the parade of sad wrecks through my life, date after bad date after bad boyfriend. She was the one who'd picked up the pieces after the musician, the investment banker, the humanitarian who was human to everyone but me.  When at last she spoke, she said, Oh, hell.  And, after that: Hallelujah.
The desire for connection with the Divine and our formless inner self is at the foundation of all desire for human connection.
Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.
The blame of course belonged to Clyde, who just was not much given to talk. Also, he seemed very little curious himself: Grady, alarmed sometimes by the meagerness of his inquiries and the indifference this might suggest, supplied him liberally with personal information; which isn't to say she always told the truth, how many people in love do? or can? but at least she permitted him enough truth to account more or less accurately for all the life she had lived away from him. It was her feeling, however, that he would as soon not hear her confessions: he seemed to want her to be as elusive, as secretive as he was himself.
There is no guilt in feelings ever.
His love for me seemed to overflow my limits by its flood of wealth and service. But my necessity was more for giving than foe receiving; for love is a vagabond, who can make his flowers bloom in the wayside dust, better than in the crystal jars kept in the drawing-room.
The moment you put someone on a pedestal they will look down upon you. The trick is respecting each other equally.
SELFLESS LOVE. If you have a special person in your life, but you find yourselves arguing, irritated and/or fighting out of the blue… you both need to try to step back and be selfless and think of the other person... with no ego of your own. No ego. We are ALL dealing with our own tough issues. We may keep them to ourselves, but we all have struggles. If you BOTH allow yourselves to step into each others shoes- to have the awareness and respect for each others issues and struggles... that will most likely allow the love that you have for each other to shine through at its brightest.  There will be ups and downs- feelings of being under-appreciated for both. It will happen. But let that be the worst that happens. Unity through diversity. That's the greatest love. A selfless love. It’s paradoxical, but you each would get back more than you give out. That's the love that conquers all things that’s mentioned in the Bible. It will be challenging for both of you, but well worth it.
Public truth telling is a form of recovery, especially when combined with social action. Sharing traumatic experiences with others enables victims to reconstruct repressed memory, mourn loss, and master helplessness, which is trauma's essential insult. And, by facilitating reconnection to ordinary life, the public testimony helps survivors restore basic trust in a just world and overcome feelings of isolation. But the talking cure is predicated on the existence of a community willing to bear witness. 'Recovery can take place only within the context of relationships,' write Judith Herman. 'It cannot occur in isolation.
I am getting nowhere with you and I can't let you go and I cant get through.
Anyway, you can't leave her like that. You can't do that to the woman. She doesn't deserve it; nobody does. You don't belong to her and she doesn't belong to you, but you're both part of each other; if she got up and left now and walked away and you never saw each other again for the rest of your lives, and you lived an ordinary waking life for another fifty years, even so on your deathbed you would still know she was part of you.
Security comes first from inside of you. Then, if you are very lucky, you will be in a position to find other people who also possess that same sort of security, and build some sort of family or community as a team.
Emancipation of women has made them lose their mystery.
When a man cheats, it is said it is because he is a dog. When a woman cheats, it is said it is because her man is a dog.
If you listen closely, silence can be deafening.
Sex can lead to nasty things like herpes, gonorrhea, and something called relationships.
I hate everything about her except for the fact that I love everything about her.
If you really love someone. You wouldn't hide them. You would be proud to let the whole world know that you have feelings for that special someone. If I got asked who do I love. I would straight up say the name. Just imagine how special that person would feel to know that you aren't afraid or embarrassed to let everyone know that person means a lot to you. However, sometimes its understandable especially when you have your friends or family against it. Which to me shouldn't matter because it's your life and we only live once. Even if it doesn't work out, we grow from our own experiences, right?
Well, clearly someone you trust isn’t really someone you should be trusting,” she said without thinking, and regretted it when Terrible glanced at her. He did it fast, just a quick cut of his eyes in her direction and then away again, but she saw it. She felt it. It was starting already. She wished she could say she was surprised, wished she hadn’t been waiting for it, expecting it the way she expected rain from black clouds overhead. Nothing in the world was permanent, especially not happiness. She’d always known that. She just wished life would stop proving her right.
Delusions are hardly an escape from reality. It’s a way of understanding insane people living in a backwards world.
Straight between them ran the pathway, Never grew the grass upon it
We are responsible for our own relationships, their successes, their failures, the good times, the bad times. Take responsibility for creating the relationships that you desire.
My mother had always taught me to write about my feelings instead of sharing really personal things with others, so I spent many evenings writing in my diary, eating everything in the kitchen and waiting for Mr. Wrong to call.
Pubic hair is proof of sexual maturity and if your partner finds that a turn-off, you should probably reconsider that partner.
I don't know," she said. "We used to squabble a lot when we were going together and then engaged and everything, but I thought everything would be so different as soon as you were married. And now I feel so sort of strange and everything. I feel so sort of alone.
I had a day when I was busy in the world, where the activity created a turmoil on the surface of my consciousness like waves on the surface of the ocean, which made it difficult to see through the waves to the inner silence.  It reminded me that we need to develop both the capacity to use the mind when engaged in activity and social relations, and to be able to let go of the activity and to come in contact with the deep inner silence.  The relationship between being active in the world and in social relations and the inner silence is like the relationship between the waves on the surface of the ocean and the deep inner silence on the bottom of the ocean.
How do people know they are sane? Can a person be gripped by lunacy, only to be released a short time later, never to relive the episode again?
All positive interactions with other human beings involve, to some degree, the experience of visibility-- that is, the experience of being seen and understood.
Or maybe I, like, cuddle raped him or something.
I was living and dying in all the fibers of what is chewed and digested and in all the fibers that absorb the sun, consuming and digesting. Under the thatched arbor of a restaurant on a river-bank, where Olivia had waited for me, our teeth began to move slowly, with equal rhythm, and our eyes stared into each other's with the intensity of serpents'—serpents concentrated in the ecstasy of swallowing each other in turn, as we were aware, in our turn, of being swallowed by the serpent that digests us all, assimilated ceaselessly in the process of ingestion and digestion, in the universal cannibalism that leaves its imprint on every amorous relationship and erases the lines between our bodies and sopa de frijoles, huachinango a la vera cru-zana, and enchiladas.
The greatest testament of a life lived is to be missed when you are gone. It is not something you can plan for or buy ahead of time. It is a sentiment that comes freely from the lives you touch in positive ways.
There's always something in it for the person who is allowing to be taken advantage of." Psychotherapist David in Type 1 Sociopath
I was lucky to meet you, yes.'  'Me too . . .' she said, looking me in the eyes. 'I was lucky too. The men I know are a disaster, not one of them believes in love; so they give you this big spiel about friendship, affection, a whole load of stuff that doesn't commit them to anything. I've got to the point where I can't stand the word 'friendship' any more, it makes me physically sick. Or there's the other lot, the ones who get married, who get hitched as early as possible and think about nothing but their careers afterwards. You obviously weren't one of those; but I also immediately sensed that you would never talk to me about friendship, that you would never be that vulgar. From the very beginning I hoped we would sleep together, that something important would happen; but it was possible that nothing would happen, in fact it was more than likely.' She stopped and sighed in irritation.
We imagined we knew everything the other thought, even when we did not necessarily want to know it, but in fact, I have come to see, we knew not the smallest fraction of what there was to know.
When we are passionately in love with our Prince, we put Him above all else--not just in theory, but also practically, in every moment of our day-to-day lives. We do not live for the applause of heaven. Our longings are not for people's approval but only for more and more of Him. We are marked by an effortless, unshakable strength that is found in the presence of our perfect Lover.
we all make vows, Jimmy. And there is something very beautiful and touching and noble about wanting good impulses to be permanent and true forever," she said. "Most of us stand up and vow to love, honor and cherish someone. And we truly mean it, at the time. But two or twelve or twenty years down the road, the lawyers are negotiating the property settlement."  "You and George didn't go back on your promises."  She laughed. "Lemme tell ya something, sweetface. I have been married at least four times, to four different men." She watched him chew that over for a moment before continuing, "They've all been named George Edwards but, believe me, the man who is waiting for me down the hall is a whole lot different animal from the boy I married, back before there was dirt. Oh, there are continuities. He has always been fun and he has never been able to budget his time properly and - well, the rest is none of your business."  "But people change," he said quietly.  "Precisely. People change. Cultures change. Empires rise and fall. Shit. Geology changes! Every ten years or so, George and I have faced the fact that we have changed and we've had to decide if it makes sense to create a new marriage between these two new people." She flopped back against her chair. "Which is why vows are such a tricky business. Because nothing stays the same forever. Okay. Okay! I'm figuring something out now." She sat up straight, eyes focused somewhere outside the room, and Jimmy realized that even Anne didn't have all the answers and that was either the most comforting thing he'd learned in a long time or the most discouraging. "Maybe because so few of us would be able to give up something so fundamental for something so abstract, we protect ourselves from the nobility of a priest's vows by jeering at him when he can't live up to them, always and forever." She shivered and slumped suddenly, "But, Jimmy! What unnatural words. Always and forever! Those aren't human words, Jim. Not even stones are always and forever.
I feel incendiary, a wildfire. My spirit licks at the gates of a very elaborate, customized, and distracting emotional Hades.
When I speak of life and love as expanding with age, sex seems the least important thing. At any age we grow by the enlarging of consciousness, by learning a new language, or a new art or craft (gardening?) that implies a new way of looking at the universe. Love is one of the great enlargers of the person because it requires us to "take in" the stranger and to understand him, and to exercise restraint and tolerance as well as imagination to make the relationship work.
I´m just not sending out the right vibe lately. Perhaps the fact that I wear stained sweatpants and free T-shirts is holding me back. I just can´t seem to get back into the intelligent-slut-for-hire outfits that lure men; even shoes with laces evade me. Plus my hair is Fran Lebowitz-esque. I think my eyes are getting closer together. I don´t know.
Finally he turned his head toward her face and brushed a kiss over her cheek. “I love you and I believe with all my heart that you love me as well. Why can’t you say it, Hero?
Playing roles in any relationship is false and will inevitably lead to the relationship's collapse. Noone can be any one thing all the time.
<i>You get what you give,"</i> we will tell his sorry, selfish ass." The Betty Lady has spoken. I detect a Bronx accent. "But," I demur, "it will make the other woman say, ´See? She IS a jealous and paranoid and pushy wife.´" The Betty Lady rips open a cell phone statement with a nail file and, without looking up at me, says, "Let me tell you something, honey. In my experience? The only thing they care about is what they see in the mirror each morning and WINNING...or their perception of winning.
Where does love go? When something you have taped on the wall falls off, what has happened to the stickum? It has relaxed. It has accumulated an assortment of hairs and fuzzies. It has said "Fuck it" and given up. It doesn't go anywhere special, it's just gone. Energy is created, and then it is destroyed. So much for the laws of physics. So much for chemistry. So much for not so much.
The teaching of the sexual tantras all come down to one point. Although desire, of whatever shape or form, seeks completion, there is another kind of union than the one we imagine. In this union, achieved when the egocentric model of dualistic thinking is no longer dominant, we are not united with it, nor am I united with you, but we all just are. The movement from object to subject, as described in both Eastern meditation and modern psychotherapy, is training for this union, but its perception usually comes as a surprise, even when this shift is well under way. It is a kind of grace. The emphasis on sexual relations in the tantric teachings make it clear that the ecstatic surprise of orgasm is the best approximation of this grace.
Without such trust and safety, social relationships tend to become strategic rather than cooperative, increasingly full of skepticism and even anxiety and fear about others' intentions. (p. 27)
Jack hadn’t thought of love as a promise before—a promise that, even when the world was falling down around him, would stay kept. But without Sutton saying a word, he knew that there would be comfort when he couldn’t sleep tonight. And tomorrow and the day after, there would be a home to go to, even if it was no more than a pair of arms around him and a head tucked close to his in the darkness.
I could hardly get a boy to look at me. All right, they'd look, they'd even take me out, but no one asked for a second date. I was too nasty, a real wise guy, and all the boys could tell what my rotten disposition was. Deep down, I wanted a commitment with a capital C. To get anywhere with me, a boy would have to sign his undying loyalty with his own blood.
There's a cover for every pot, but I've never seen so many mismatched pots and covers in all my life. - Ellen Wasserfeldman, from Notes from Ellen Wasserfeldman by Alisa Dana Steinberg
You have to shrink yourself to fit into this little life with him.
Oh, you want me to lie still while you check me out? Damn, Red, if I'd have known that earlier I would've been horizontal already.
Sand castles just aren't made to last.
My guess is that he remembers some of me, some of us together, and the rest rolled off him like topsoil in a flash flood.
Darling, whose book is this to be?"  "Ostensibly yours, my sweet"  "I see -- rather like my life since I met you?"  "Yes darling
I think we’re romantic people in some ways, but when it comes to relationships it’s not a question of ‘Can you trust another human being?’, so much as a question of trusting yourself. The animalistic nature of man seems to mean that you’re bound to find another people physically attractive. And there’s something dishonest about shutting those feelings off - it seems puritanical to deny yourself that. The idea of sin is still so widely pervading.
To be honest, going out with Ed after Josh is like moving on to Duchy Originals super-tasty seeded loaf after plastic white bread. (I don't mean to be rude about Josh. And I didn't realize it at the time. But it is. He is. Plastic white bread.)
When I was your age, if a boy behaved badly, one simply scored his name out from one's dance card. (Sadie Lancaster - to Lara Lington)
To know other people thought he'd made a mistake vindicated me. I wasn't a bad girlfriend, he was simply going through a period of temporary insanity and he'd come to his senses soon.
This was one of those moments when I realized that my emotional baggage, once a few neatly packed pieces, was now like the Joads' truck, stacked high with old clothes, half a rocking chair, a mule, all barely secured with twine.
Guilt is a feeble emotion. It surrenders too easily
And deep down, she felt like maybe she didn't deserve it-that she belonged with the petty thieves and guys who drank Pabst Blue Ribbon for breakfast
People frequently point to communication as a problem, because its easy to notice, but usually it is a symptom of an underlying problem with a relationship posture.
Those who make conversations impossible, make escalation inevitable.
Your blessings are very important to melt down the stony hearts.
What was happening to them was that every bad time produced a bad feeling that in turn produced several more bad times and several more bad feelings, so that their life together became crowded with bad times and bad feelings, so crowded that almost nothing else could grow in that dark field. But then she had a feeling of peace one morning that lingered from the evening before spent sewing while he sat reading in the next room. And a day or two later, she had a feeling of contentment that lingered in the morning from the evening before when he kept her company in the kitchen while she washed the dinner dishes. If the good times increased, she thought, each good time might produce a good feeling that would in turn produce several more good times that would produce several more good feelings. What she meant was that the good times might multiply perhaps as rapidly as the square of the square, or perhaps more rapidly, like mice, or like mushrooms springing up overnight from the scattered spore of a parent mushroom which in turn had sprung up overnight with a crowd of others from the scattered spore of a parent, until her life with him with be so crowded with good times that the good times might crowd out the bad as the bad times had by now almost crowded out the good.
..begin by talking about the kind of existentialist chaos that exists in our own lives and our inability to overcome the sense of alienation and frustration we experience when we try to create bonds of intimacy and solidarity with one another. Now part of this frustration is to be understood again in relation to structures and institutions. In the way in which our culture of consumption has promoted an addiction to stimulation - one that puts a premium on packaged and commodified stimulation. The market does this to convince us that our consumption keeps oiling the economy for it to reproduce itself. But the effect of this addiction to stimulation is an undermining, a waning of our ability for qualitatively rich relationships.
Women Empowerment Reminder of The Day. Always respect yourself as a woman. You attract what you are, so be very mindful of how you’re representing yourself. If you want respect, you must first learn how to respect yourself, first. Attracting negative attention is never a good thing. Be a woman of substance! Be a woman that both women and men respect, admire, and look up to. Don’t disrespect yourself by lowering your standards and accepting just anything that comes your way. It’s okay to be single! If you want a relationship of substance, you can’t keep entertaining people and things that mean you no good. Think about it! It’s all up to you.
Be real and be unashamed, even of your faults. I do truly know what my husband is made of and vice versa.
The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether the same.
...It's just nice to see you out from his shadow. Because things don't grow in the shadows, you know? So it was frustrating to see you standing there...and really cool to see you step out of it. I don't know who this new guy is, but make sure when you're with him, you're not standing in his shadow. Stand where everyone can see you.
In this quiet place on a quiet street where no one ever finds us gently, lovingly, freedom gives back our pain. --from poem In a Quiet Place on a Quiet Street
I have never understood why a woman must have a man to take her into dinner.
He should in humility have asked her why it was that he was naturally a cuckold, why two women of different temperaments and characters had been inspired to have lovers at his expense. He should be telling her, with the warmth of her body warming his, that his second wife had confessed to greater sexual pleasure when she remembered that she was deceiving him.
A human being basically could not live alone. I had always thought of one’s soul as an imperfect creature; God had created it that way to allow the need to exist –the need to have relationships with other people in order to always run after the one obsession that had humanity seeking it on regular basis –perfection. Whether that relationship was between family members, friends, co-workers or even a romantic relationship, it was always people’s way to achieve flawlessness since they couldn’t accomplish it on their own.
There was a warmth of fury in his last phrases. He meant she loved him more than he her. Perhaps he could not love her. Perhaps she had not in herself that which he wanted. It was the deepest motive of her soul, this self-mistrust. It was so deep she dared neither realise nor acknowledge. Perhaps she was deficient. Like an infinitely subtle shame, it kept her always back. If it were so, she would do without him. She would never let herself want him. She would merely see.
The kiss intimately relates to the most primitive kind of human contact, which can satisfy all of our needs, like: feeding, enjoying pleasure, tasting, wanting, rejecting, everything we associate with love.
It had all seemed as inevitable as sunset. Instead it was the beauty of the sun glinting upon the scythe.
We tried to act familiar, which meant we couldn't ask the kind of questions that might have helped us figure each other out and year after year the distance grew.
For better or for worse, but not for lunch,...
Some women have been faking orgasms for so long that they sometimes fake one when they are masturbating.
You can't compare men or women with mental disorders to the normal expectations of men and women in without mental orders. Your dealing with symptoms and until you understand that you will always try to find sane explanations among insane behaviors. You will always have unreachable standards and disappointments. If you want to survive in a marriage to someone that has a disorder you have to judge their actions from a place of realistic expectations in regards to that person's upbringing and diagnosis.
That fist he was raising at me would wham into the cupboard door, hurting only himself. I saw it all happening, then it really did happen. But I didn't understand the whore thing. Why was he confusing the drinking with the other? Then I got it. Obvious. It was all mixed up for him, all the same thing: the drinking, the other, anything that could make a woman free.
A while back, when Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like, Barry proposed the idea of a questionnaire for prospective partners.
It was masturbation, not willpower, that made it possible for gazillions of women to walk down the aisle with their reputation and their hymen still intact.
(Her husband's departure ...) had picked Mildred up by the hair and dropped her down at the doorstep of insanity. From "Butterfly on F street
And she realized everything one does is just another effort to be understood by someone a little bit more.
Two birds went for dating. The male bird was killed and the female bird is being murdered.
I went back to my room and spent all night contemplating whether it was possible in life not to be constantly let down. If it could ever be worth pinning your happiness to another person, when all other people ever seemed to do was disappear.
The truth is, that one doesn't really know anything about anybody. Not even the people who are nearest to you...' 'Isn't that going a little too far--exaggerating too much?' 'I don't think it is. When you think of people, it is in the image you have made of them for yourself.
Love is as much a question of the will as it is of the emotion. And if you will to love somebody, you can. - Ravi Zacharias' brother
I wanted, for so long, for someone to understand me better than I understood myself, to take control of me, to save me, to make it all better. I thought that the hardest part of a loving, mutually healing relationship would be showing my vulnerable, raw spots to a person, even though I'd been hurt so many times before. This has not been the hardest part. The actual hardest part has been realizing that no one, no matter how compassionate and kind they are, will say the perfect things always. Myself included. The hardest part has been learning to communicate what I need, to hear what others need, to tell others how to tell me what they need. Intimacy takes a lot of communication. We all have triggers. I don't know your triggers and you don't know mine. No matter how much I love or trust you, you cannot possibly know exactly the words I need to hear, the words I don't want to hear, and the way I like to be touched. And how strange that we expect these things of each other. How strange, and self-sabotaging, that we refuse to get into relationships and friendships with people unless they treat us in just that perfect way. We've been raised to want fairy tales. We've been raised to wait for flawless saviors to rescue us. But the savior isn't flawless and the savior is not coming. The savior is you. The savior is still learning. The savior is never done learning. The savior is a human being. Forget perfect. Forget flawless. And start speaking your truth. Start speaking what you want and how you want it. And start asking and listening, really listening, to what the people around you say. Maybe, then, we will stop abandoning and hurting each other. Maybe, then, there's hope for us.
True confidence is not about what you take from someone to restore yourself, but what you give back to your critics because they need it more than you do.
It seemed funny that one day I would go to bed in her arms and the next not feel anything, like a switch had gone off. But no, that wasn’t honest either. This had been building for a long time. Our silences were getting longer. Our arguments more frequent. How do you stay with someone when there are no dreams to build? No purpose to accomplish? No meaning? No meaning —that was the monster that drove us away from one another in the end. Always.
Never hesitate to let the one you love know how you feel. Align your minds, synchronise your hearts and above be fearless when dancing with their souls.
Bloody men are like bloody buses — You wait for about a year And as soon as one approaches your stop Two or three others appear.  You look at them flashing their indicators, Offering you a ride. You’re trying to read the destinations, You haven’t much time to decide.  If you make a mistake, there is no turning back. Jump off, and you’ll stand there and gaze While the cars and the taxis and lorries go by And the minutes, the hours, the days.
I hope you outlive me so I never have to know what life is like without you.
To feel aroused is to feel alive. Having great sex is like taking in huge lungfuls of fresh air, essential to your body, essential to your health, and essential to your life.
The most empowering relationships are those in which each partner lifts the other to a higher possession of their own being.
In choosing a mate, don't pick the tallest and most handsome or the most beautiful. Don't choose one just because that person raises your physical passions. Look for the person who is good from within, the one with substance and worth.
Then I met Linda and the sun rose. I can't find a better way to express it. The sun rose in my life. At first, as dawn breaking on the horizon, almost as if to say, this is where you have to look. Then came the first rays of sunshine, everything became clearer, lighter, more alive, and I became happier and happier, and then it hung in the sky of my life and shone and shone and shone.
Friendship is not by force but by choice. You can never please everybody, he who aims to please everybody will end up pleasing nobody.
I had a dream about you. I was a ventriloquist trying to share your fashion secrets, but you wouldn’t talk. So we put on a strip show for the department store sale, and I was arrested for theft – I took away your dignity as a mannequin
The more a woman appreciates the hunting prowess of her man, the more he will kill for her.
Strong relationships come from well-bonded friendships.
A relationship will either make the majority of your life happy or miserable. It is important to take your time and make sure that it is a wise choice before making a commitment.
When your tears become invisible, disappear
We must admit that simply knowing the contents of the Bible is not a sure route to spiritual growth. There is an aweful assumption in evangelical churches that if we can just get the Word of God into people's heads, then the Spirit of God will apply it to their hearts. That assumption is aweful, not because the Spirit never does what the assumption supposes, but because it excused pastors and leaders from the responsibility to tangle with people's lives. Many remain safely hidden behind pulpits, hopelessly out of touch with the struggles of their congregations, proclaiming the Scriptures with a pompous accuracy that touches no one. Pulpits should provide bridges, not barriers, to life-changing relationships.
That happens a lot with Shakespeare. The women go after what they want; the men wind up suckered into things.
Let's hope that for every time that we get hurt or break our heart, there is something somewhere being written to make up for it, to make the happiness due even bigger and laughters even merrier, for after all good things must happen to good people.
Life is too short to not kick fear in the ass and allow yourself to love again.
I asked if you was pleased.’ ‘Course I’m pleased! You think I’d be mad if I wasn’t pleased?’ ‘You don’t make a lick of sense,’ he says, but he is smiling now and he takes a step closer to me.
Eli . . .” I rasped. I lost track of where his kisses landed, where his fingers touched, and grew too comfortable in his arms. “I can’t.”  “You can,” he urged, pulling back and grinding my hips against his. Heat quickly rushed to my cheeks. “I have you. I found you, and I’m not letting you go.”  “You don’t—” Eli’s mouth crashed down on mine, stealing a kiss, and I freakin’ lost it. His mouth was absolutely sinful and there was nothing gentle about him, either. Eli was out for something good and was determined to get it. Euphoria sliced through my drunken haze and I grinned as I kissed him back. When his hands slid up my dress and his tongue pushed past my teeth, I moaned loudly and wrapped my legs around his waist.  Just this. I can do this.  Eli’s fingers inched closer to my panties and I threw my head back against the building to catch my breath.  Oh, my God.  Lights flashed behind my eyes and the red and blue spots showered over me like rain. “I-I have a wedding tomorrow. My friend’s,” I muttered, almost pulling away. To my ears, it didn’t even sound like a coherent sentence.  “Cielo, I don’t really care.” Eli glanced up at me from his place between my flushed breasts and leaned in to suck my bottom lip into his mouth.  “I’m drunk.”  “Good.” His hand beneath my dress tugged and I heard the audible rip of my panties. “So am I.
Every day I’m convinced that I can’t possibly love you more… and every day I’m proven wrong.
Every specific human being, however, thinks, judges, imagines, wills and expresses himself or herself in a unique, dissimilar, and unrepeatable mode--a mode of unpredictable difference, or otherness, which objectively defies description or delimitation.
Maybe it's impossible to find everything you want in one person. Maybe everyone in your life gives you certain things you need. And your friends give you the rest of what you can't get from your boyfriend.
The bottom line was that I was in an abusive relationship.
She is my friend, and there is nothing you can say or do that can stop me from helping her.
You are set free whenever you love—even those who believe you're crazy.
KM: Yes. Mrs. Lopez, she's human. And you know, clearly, she'd like people to show some appreciation for her hard work. But if people just, you know, take her pie and don't even say, "Hey, nice pie," they just scarf it down or whatever- MH: I could see how that would get to be annoying. I mean, if you're constantly providing...pie. And getting no positive feedback- KM: Right! And what about your future? I mean, how do you know people are still going to want your pie in the future? Supposing they become a famous rock star or something. People are going to be offering them pie all over the place. If they haven't promised only to eat your pie, well, where does that leave you?
Hmm. Relationships between fathers and sons can be notoriously difficult, especially for two men who are as different as you and your father are." "Yes, and he's also the king--that makes our relationship impossible.
It's disconcerting to realize how little you have to say to someone who once occupied such a prominent place in your bed.
Yet even in the loneliness of the canyon I knew there were others like me who had brothers they did not understand but wanted to help. We are probably those referred to as "our brother's keepers," possessed of one of the oldest and possible one of the most futile and certainly one of the most haunting instincts. It will not let us go.
Sometimes I feel like relationships consist of telling your same life stories to different people until someone finally appreciates them.
Even after centuries of human interacting, children still continue to rebel against their parents and siblings. Young marrieds look upon their in-laws and parents as obstacles to their independence and growth. Parents view their children as selfish ingrates. Husbands desert their wives and seek greener fields elsewhere. Wives form relationships with heroes of soap operas who vicariously bring excitement and romance into their empty lives. Workers often hate their bosses and co-workers and spend miserable hours with them, day after day. On a larger scale, management cannot relate with labour. Each accuses the other of unreasonable self-interests and narrow-mindedness. Religious groups often become entrapped, each in a provincial dogma resulting in hate and vindictiveness in the name of God. Nations battle blindly, under the shadow of the world annihilation, for the realization of their personal rights. Members of these groups blame rival groups for their continual sense of frustration, impotence, lack of progress and communication. We have obviously not learned much over the years. We have not paused long enough to consider the simple truth that we humans are not born with particular attitudinal sets regarding other persons, we are taught into them. We are the future generation's teachers. We are, therefore, the perpetrators of the confusion and alienation we abhor and which keeps us impotent in finding new alternatives. It is up to us to diligently discover new solutions and learn new patterns of relating, ways more conducive to growth, peace, hope and loving coexistence. Anything that is learned can be unlearned and relearned. In this process called change lies our real hope.
You can trust everyone to be human, with all the quirks and inconsistencies we humans display, including disloyalty, dishonesty and downright treachery. We are all capable of the entire range of human behavior, given the circumstances, from absolute saintliness to abject depravity. Trusting someone to limit their sphere of action to one narrow band on the spectrum is idealistic and will inevitably lead to disappointment. On the other hand, you can decide to trust that everyone is doing their best according to their particular stage of development, and to give everyone their appropriate berth. For this to work, you have to trust yourself to make and have made the right choices that will lead you on the path to your healthy growth. You have to trust yourself to come through every experience safely and enriched. But don’t trust what I am saying. Listen and then decide for yourself. Does this information sit easily in your belly? You know when you trust yourself around someone because your belly feels settled and your heart feels warm.
It struck her all at once that dealing with other human beings was an awful lot of work.
That chain of relationships made me think of how connections are made--you read a book, you meet a person, you have a single experience, and your life is changed in some way. No act, therefore, however small, should be dismissed or ignored.
Her violence frightened me. She always claimed that I was the jealous one, and I was often jealous, but when I saw things working against me I simply became disgusted and withdrew. Lydia was different. She reacted. She was the Head Cheerleader at the Game of Violence.
Loving relationships, though necessary for life, health, and growth, are among the most complicated skills. Before we can be successful at achieving relationships, it is necessary that we broaden our understanding of how they work, what they mean and how what we do and believe can enhance or destroy them. We can accomplish this only if we are willing to put in the energy and take the time to study failed relationships as well as examine successful ones. Loving relationships cannot be taken lightly. Unless we are looking for pain, they must not be forever approached in a trial and error fashion. Too many of us have experienced the cost of these lackadaisical approaches in terms of tears, confusion and guilt.
We can't talk about it, or I know she won't so I don't even try, but it's what goes unsaid between people tat builds up like masonry. You have to either knock the bricks out with other things, or let them keep stacking until eventually you are alone in a room.
Instructions For Wayfarers  They will declare: Every journey has been taken. You shall respond: I have not been to see myself. They will insist: Everything has been spoken. You shall reply: I have not had my say.  They will tell you: Everything has been done. You shall reply: My way is not complete.  You are warned: Any way is long, any way is hard. Fear not. You are the gate - you, the gatekeeper. And you shall go through and on . . .  —Alexandros Evangelou Xenopouloudakis, THIRD WISH
He told me that from now on, everything I did and everything he did was of the utmost importance: any word spoken, the slightest gesture, would take on a meaning, and everything that happened between us would change us continually. 'For that reason,'he said,'I wish I were able to suspend time at this moment and keep things exactly at this point, because I feel this instant is a true beginning. We have a definite but unknown quantity of experience at our disposal. As soon as the hourglass is turned, the sand will begin to run out and once it starts, it cannot stop until it's all gone. That's why I wish I could hold it back at the start. We should make a minimum of gestures, pronounce a minimum of words, even see each other as seldom as possible, if that would prolong things. We don't know how much of everything we have ahead of us so we have to take the greatest precautions not to destroy the beauty of what we have. Everything exists in limited quantity-especially happiness. If a love is to come into being, it is all written down somewhere, and also its duration and content. If you could arrive at the complete intensity the first day, it would be ended the first day. And so if it's something you want so much that you'd like to have it prolonged in time, you must be extremely careful not to make the slightest excessive demand that might prevent it from developing to the greatest extent over the longest period...If the wings of the butterfly are to keep their sheen, you mustn't touch them. We mustn't abuse something which is to bring light into both our lives. Everything else in my life only weighs me down and shuts out the light. This thing wih you seems like a window that is opening up. I want it to remain open...
Yes,” said Mamma, “this is the worst of life, that love does not give us common sense but is a sure way of losing it. We love people, and we say that we are going to do more for them than friendship, but it makes such fools of us that we do far less, indeed sometimes what we do could be mistaken for the work of hatred.
A real relationship doesn't properly begin until the NRE burns away. That's when you have to start dealing with this person as an all-around human being, replete with irritating little habits. When disillusion sets in, love can begin.
You do not get what you wish for, unless it be known to the source of your desire.
Sound crazy? It may well be, but it is precisely in relationships of intimacy that your craziness (and mine) will be hardest to conceal. p.215
There's nothing wrong with wanting to be with someone."  "There is when your only reason is the being, not the someone.
If you stay in the company of anger, pain, or hurt, happiness will find someone else to visit.
But then you hear that he can't hear you, you see that he can't see you. You are not here--and you haven't even died yet. You see yourself through his eyes, as The Generic Woman, the skirted symbol on the ladies' room door.
But I do not know what to tell myself. Stuart needs "space" and "time," as if this were physics and not a human relationship.
Katie says, "You can't choose the time and place the when and where with whom you fall in love."  She says, "It just happens like that weird feeling you get right before you fall asleep when you gasp in surprise because your muscles just relaxed and you feel like you are falling."  She says, "Marcie, you shouldn't worry about it -- give it time to actually happen."  I guess --  I worry that I won't do it right. That it'll be the wrong time, the wrong place, the wrong person.
In the mainstream, with its illusion of unlimited relational possibilities, we can counter dissatisfaction in relationships by simply moving on in search of the "right people." But community...demands we cultivate friendships with people we might not choose ordinarily. Founding friendship on commitment rather than "chemistry" often requires adjustment...At the end of the day, however, we have found that any loss of chemistry in relationships is more than made up for with gains in meaning.
Never enter relationships. Otherwise, suffer the pains that come with it. Enjoy your individuality while you can.
most men know what they hate; few what they love
(In reference to swingers) In the meantime, if you wish to declare yourself polyamorous, get used to the fact that the confusion is gong to remain as a pejorative. Sure, clear up the misunderstanding as much as you can, but don't put too much effort into setting yourself up as a "good", responsible, community-oriented polyamorist by contrasting yourself to the "bad" swingers - they may not be your siblings, but they're definitely your cousins.
She re-read his email four times, feeling offended and breathless, like he had casually grabbed her head and stuffed it into a pile of wet leaves.
She knew breaking up with Ethan was going to be a full-time job because being in a relationship with him had also been a full-time job.
This is what we do. Not so much argue as joust, in jest. We can't stop pushing and pulling the taffy of words and concepts.
For me, it´s sloth," I say. "Hedonistic sloth and escapism.
What the trees can do handsomely-greening and flowering, fading and then the falling of leaves-human beings cannot do with dignity, let alone without pain.
When one has let go of that great hidden agenda that drives humanity and its varied histories, then one can begin to encounter the immensity of one's own soul. If we are courageous enough to say, "Not this person, nor any other, can ultimately give me what I want; only I can," then we are free to celebrate a relationship for what it can give.
How can I expect readers to know who I am if I do not tell them about my family, my friends, the relationships in my life? Who am I if not where I fit in the world, where I fit in the lives of the people dear to me?
The early church was strikingly different from the culture around it in this way - the pagan society was stingy with its money and promiscuous with its body. A pagan gave nobody their money and practically gave everybody their body. And the Christians came along and gave practically nobody their body and they gave practically everybody their money.
As important as your obligations as a doctor, lawyer or business leader will be, you are a human being first. And these human connections with spouse, with children and with friends are the most important investments you will ever make. At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child or a parent. One thing will never change. Fathers and Mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read to your children, you must hug your children and you must love your children…. Your success as a family, our success as a society depends not what happens at the White House, but what happens inside YOUR house.
He mentioned the connection between us. He identified with me. These are the things that many people want to hear, that most “normal” people want to be able to truthfully say, but almost no one can.
Argumentation is a human enterprise that is embedded in a larger social and psychological context. This context includes (1) the total psyches of the two persons engaged in dialogue, (2) the relationship between the two persons, (3) the immediate situation in which they find themselves and (4) the larger social, cultural and historical situation surrounding them.
They can talk shit about each other behind the others' backs, but when it comes down to it, money is the one true race and everyone down here is the color of greenbacks and as tall as mountains.
...workplace dynamics are no less complicated or unexpectedly intense than family relations, with only the added difficulty that whereas families are at least well-recognised and sanctioned loci for hysteria reminiscent of scenes from Medea, office life typically proceeds behind a mask of shallow cheerfulness, leaving workers grievously unprepared to handle the fury and sadness continually aroused by their colleagues.
There are persons whom in my heart I despise, others I abhor. Yet I am not obliged to inform the one of my contempt, nor the other of my detestation. This kind of dissimulation...is a necessary branch of wisdom, and so far from being immoral...that it is a duty and a virtue.
I couldn't take much more of this. Being the object two men competed for wasn't as glamorous as it sounded in the movies. The two men who both wanted one hundred percent of my time weren't dashing, international playboys. They were undead and surprisingly immature, considering the youngest was just over a hundred years old.
Betsy hadn't had sex, actual; sex-sex, full sex, in two hundred and fifty-three days. She decided on her thirty-seventh birthday that she wouldn't sleep with anyone unless it was in the context of a committed relationship which had some sort of future, and she was only gradually coming to the realization of what happens when a woman her age makes a decision like that: she never has sex again.
It takes two to have a fight.
There is a part of us that knows the timing of any relationship. It knows things that we cannot work out. It knows when to say yes. It knows when to say no. It knows when to wait. It knows when something has finished. It knows when something has started. It knows when we have a responsibility to another person. It knows when the ties are untied. It will not betray us or another.
It's so weird that adults in committed relationships have a problem with something so innocuous as flirting. I would never expect you to walk around with a paper bag over your head to avoid catching the eye of a stranger, nor would I discourage you making friendly conversation with whomever you might encounter during the day. And if you needed to fuck somebody else, we could talk about it. People change, our desires evolve, and it feels foolish to me to expect what you'll want two, five, or ten years from now will be exactly the same thing that fills you up today. I mean, the way I feel about fidelity has evolved over the last ten years of my life. It's a hard-and-fast rule that we don't apply to any other thing in our lives: YOU MUST LOVE THIS [SHOW/BOOK/FOOD/SHIRT] WITH UNWAVERING FERVOR FOR THE REST OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE. Could you imagine being forced to listen to your favorite record from before your music tastes were refined for the rest of your life? Right now I'm pretty sure I could listen to Midnight Snack by HOMESHAKE for the rest of my life, but me ten years ago was really into acoustic Dave Matthews, and I'm not sure how I feel about that today. And yes, I am oversimplifying it, but really, if in seven years you want to have sex with the proverbial milkman, just let me know about it beforehand so I can hide my LaCroix and half eaten wedge of port salut. ('Milkmen' always eat all the good snacks.)
Don't be too busy climbing the ladder of success and forget your most cherished relationships (friends, family, spouse, etc). EnjoyLife!
Your body would not get sick if you held no thought of resentment. It is neither good nor bad of itself. If we hold anything against anyone, we will suffer ourselves.
Judging Natalie as my mother had judged me was, I felt like telling her son, just my ass-backward way of showing love. I'd spent my life trying to translate that language, and now I realized I had come to speak it fluently. When was it that you realized the thread woven through your DNA carried the relationship deformities of your blood relatives as much as it did their diabetes and bone density?
If you worked out enough, maybe the man would too. Maybe you would be able to work it out together, as if the two of you were a puzzle that could be solved; otherwise, one of you, most likely the man, taking his addictive body with him and leaving you with bad withdrawal, which you could counteract by exercise. If you didn't work it out it was because one of you had the wrong attitude.
It is 10 PM now, and Godzilla has been sitting at his desk in front of his laptop for six to seven hours. He has accomplished hardly anything today. Godzilla is drinking a lot of beer. He can not stop smoking cigarettes. His room is blue with cigarette smoke, and Godzilla sits on a chair in there, minimizing and maximizing Mozilla Firefox repeatedly. He is not over his girlfriend's house because she said on the cell phone that she needed time, alone, to think about their relationship. Godzilla worries that he will not be able to take care of himself if they break up.
Look for the positive qualities in your client's negative behavior.
I didn't want to pick at Micah and me until we unraveled. I wanted to leave it alone and enjoy it. I just didn't know how to do that.
Mom has the Touch. She knows what flowers go with what occasions, what hors d'oeuvres work with what people. She believes passionately in the power of food to heal, restore, and stimulate relationships, and she has built a following of loyal customers who really hope she's right. If she's wrong, says Sonia, no one wants to know.
S'il n y a pas de rapport sexuel c'est que l'Autre est d'une autre race.
The golden rule of business is supply and demand. I venture to say that this is also the rule of happiness. When a balance is achieved between our desires and another's willingness to satisfy them, the result is a sympathetic, mutually rewarding relationship. (...) a thriving economy of love.' - character Mike Lambeth
The engineer’s ready capitulation, however, did not hide from the poet’s mother the sad realization that the adventure into which she had plunged so impulsively--and which had seemed so intoxicatingly beautiful--had no turned out to be the great, mutually fulfilling love she was convinced she had a full right to expect. Her father was the owner of two prosperous Prague pharmacies, and her morality was based on strict give-and-take. For her part, she had invested everything in love (she had even been willing to sacrifice her parents and their peaceful existence); in turn, she had expected her partner to invest an equal amount of capital of feelings in the common account. To redress the imbalance, she gradually withdrew her emotional deposit and after the wedding presented a proud, severe face to her husband.
Friendships - and indeed most relationships - are measured in the closeness of hearts,  minds and soul ties... not in the distance of physical miles or even the passing of time.
Relationships are valuable no matter who they are between.
I loved being near you. Even though I felt that bubble you had around you, even though I never quite knew what you were thinking, damn, did I love being near you. Somehow, I knew you would rip me apart and drown me. Somehow, I knew we wouldn’t last. It didn’t matter. You were my sun. I loved feeling you upon me, around me, between me. Even though you could only love me from a distance, I didn’t care. I never felt more warmth inside of me than when you were against me.
Intimacy requires accommodation and gentleness at it's core, and does with phrases like "If it bothers you I won't do it," and "Now I understand." And "Thank you for telling me that. I hadn't seen it in that light." And "I appreciate you taking the time to get through my defences. I am sorry I put up such a fight." You'd be surprised how much power there is in respect, and how much respect comes back, and how much intimacy there is when you empower someone instead of overpower them, and how much more love.
This is one of the marks of a truly safe person: they are confrontable.
Making someone feel obligated, pressured or forced into doing something of a sexual nature that they don't want to is sexual coercion. This includes persistent attempts at sexual contact when the person has already refused you. Nobody owes you sex, ever; and no means no, always.
For the first time in my life, I felt the pain of missing people I had not yet left.
In some ways, we will always be different. In other ways, we will always be the same. There is always room to disagree and blame, just as there is always room to take a new perspective and empathize. Understanding is a choice.
Relationships are steppingstones for the evolution of our consciousness. Each interaction we have, be it one of joy or contrast, allows us to learn more about who we are and what we want in this lifetime. They bring us into greater alignment…as long as we continue to move forward and do not get attached to hurt, anger, or being a victim.
He didn't take any of my shit. I needed that.
Loving you was like jumping into the dark side of a pool, and drowning.
Friendship happens when the distance between the hearts tends to zero.
Love is being able to view a situation without adding duality to it.
What you reject today, you could accept tomorrow. And what you accept today, you could reject tomorrow. Never say never unless you can predict the future.
I am a diamond in the rut. A diamond to an untrained eye looks like a rock stone. So men will kick it around on the ground. It takes a man with an expert eye for fine Jewelry to notice its worth. Do not feel bad when men treat you like the little boys in Africa who gave away stones in exchange for candy. The hungry boys thought they were getting something better but had exchange wealth for a sugar high. Some men will do that. Exchange a valuable woman for the transient high of another. The boys didn't know better and so do some of these men. They don't know your worth.
In the way that you need to clear the way to make a road, those who betray and abandon you expose things you need to remove from your life. They reveal the mistakes you made in trusting them and how you can avoid them in the future, and move on.
There is the purity of love, harmonious in every way, but not meant for a lifetime, and then there is the steady love of commitment - no less real but completely different. She had both.
Baths, she thought, were just like her relationships, all "ooh, ah" in the beginning and then suddenly, without warning, she had to get out, out, out!
Love is supposed to lift you up, not hold you down. It is supposed to push you forward, not hold you back.
Through love, tribes have been intermixing colors to reveal a new rainbow world. And as more time passes, this racial and cultural blending will make it harder for humans to side with one race, nation or religion over another.
If there's one person in the world you should be with, there must be one person in the world you shouldn't be with.
Accept that what you see is what you'll get. Once your relationship becomes firmly established, your partner's personality and the way in which [he or] she treats you will most likely be what your future together will look like. Staying with a partner whom you hope will change usually results in disappointment.
To lovers there.  Most ladies the reason they are dumped and their relationship doesn't last is they made themselves to become a want than a need in a relationship.
I lean against my sister's shoulder. "I thought lightning wasn't supposed to strike in the same place twice."  "Sure it does," Izzy tells me. "But only if you're too dumb to move.
Finally, Carol said in a tone of hopelessness, "Darling, can I ask you to forgive me?"   The tone hurt Therese more than the question. "I love you, Carol."   "But do you see what it means?
Even a friendship needs an effort from both sides, how can we expect a relationship to work from the effort of one..!!   It should be a true-hearted commitment from both involve.
They kissed in the middle of the sidewalk, letting the crowds of people flow around them like water around an island.
In a sudden and soundless eruption, as if he has fallen into a waking dream, a stream of images pours down, images of women he has known on two continents, some from so far away in time that he barely recognizes them. Like leaves blown on the wind, pell-mell, they pass before him. A fair field full of folk: hundreds of lives all tangled with his. He holds his breath, willing the vision to continue.  What has happened to them, all those women, all those lives? Are there moments when they too, or some of them, are plunged without warning into the ocean of memory? The German girl: is it possible that at this very instant she is remembering the man who picked her up on the roadside in Africa and spent the night with her?   Enriched: that was the word the newspapers picked on to jeer at. A stupid word to let slip, under the circumstances, yet now, at this moment, he would stand by it. By Melanie, by the girl in Touws River; by Rosalind, Bev Shaw, Soraya: by each of them he was enriched, and by the others too, even the least of them, even the failures. Like a flower blooming in his breast, his heart floods with thankfulness.
Relationships are used by the darkness to keep people revolving around the ego’s demands. For a moment, people see the light of the divine in each other. They run to it and then quickly forget the light they once saw as their fears reclaim their consciousness. Thus begins the ongoing battle to protect one’s own ‘rights’, in case they be forgotten or betrayed. The tally of what is owed is counted, the guilt of perceived wrong doings is cast upon the other, one’s freedom must be paid as the price for ‘love’, and it is only in short periods of peace when all of this is forgotten. Those moments are the precious windows of the Soul.
I was always moved when mean people were suddenly nice to me. It was a weakness that would lead me into some bad relationships later in life.
I like the disaster of the night sky, stars spilling this way and that as if they were upturned from a glass. I like the way good madness feels. I like the way laughter always spills. That's the word for it. It never just comes, it spills. I like the word 'again'. Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. I like the quiet sound a coffee cup makes when it's set down on a wooden table. So hushed. So inviting. Like morning light yawning through the window and stretching out onto the kitchen floor. I like the way girls' lips look like they're stained with berries. I like the way morning light breaks like a prism through the empty wine bottles on our dusty apartment floor. Glasses empty except for the midnight hour. I like the way blueberries stain my fingers during the summer. I like the way light hits your eyes and turns it into a color that doesn't exist anywhere else other than in this moment. I want it all. I want the breeze to call my name as it rushes down my street, looking for me. I want to feel grass underneath my bare feet and I want to feel the sun kiss freckles onto my cheeks. I want to hear you yell hello as you make your way towards me, not goodbye as you have to go.   That's just a little bit about me.
I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available. I stay with him because I choose to everyday that I wake up, everyday that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.
I also have no idea how to be a girlfriend. I love sleeping alone and I avoid sick people at all costs. I don't even cook for myself, so I need someone who appreciates a lovingly baked frozen pizza.
When you have the power to love, that strength, that courage is infinite; that love is infinite. There is nothing finite about it's presence, for love. never. dies.
I love being aroused.  I relish that delicious feeling of freedom, the delirium of being naked, and my flesh being born again.   It’s like I’m being made new.
Some women marry houses.
If you have time to whine then you have time to find solution.
Even "meant to be" takes work.
It was the impatience of the way he tore my panties from my body, that really turned me on: I was all he could think of, as his lust got the better of him.   I glanced back, and saw the underwear torn and discarded, a little strip of thin black material on the floor, and thought, <i>Yes, this is the kind of impatient sex I’m looking for.</i>   The way they looked so small, and cruelly forgotten, was a beautiful symbol of how much we both needed to satisfy our lusts.
12% of people marry because they are completely in love. 88% of people marry just so they are then liable for only half of their rent.
Love life comes last in my life. I put real life first.
I got an image in my head that never got out. We see a great many things and can remember a great many things, but that is different. We get very few of the true images in our heads of the kind I am talking about, the kind that become more and more vivid for us as if the passage of the years did not obscure their reality but, year by year, drew off another veil to expose a meaning which we had only dimly surmised at first. Very probably the last veil will not be removed, for there are not enough years, but the brightness of the image increases and our conviction increases that the brightness is meaning, or the legend of meaning, and without the image our lives would be nothing except an old piece of film rolled on a spool and thrown into a desk drawer among the unanswered letters.
Sometimes we can focus so much on nothing that we make it a big something of nothing
Being single is definitely better than being with the wrong person
If a boy doesn't respect his mother...run!
Nakajima’s past would always be there, so the foundation could crumble at any moment. That’s what happens, I realized, when people destroy other people.
If you have nothing in common with the person you are dating and his parents hate you and your friends hate him, this is not romantic; it's a bad idea.
Adversity is a mirage. People, situations, and relationships sometimes change for the worst but inevitably clear a path for far better replacements. The continued journey will always find bliss.
There's this total manwhore phenomenon happening, where even the geeks are player now. It's like Manhattan is this giant playground and guys want to keep playing forever.
Strangers will show you the way  But a true friend will escort you,  to your destination.  1st November, 2006
It's one thing to say you think someone "hung the moon" but that generally means you are blind and deluded, and then the relationship fails because they say you changed, when really, they never saw you at all...The real test is if someone sees all your flaws or blemishes or individual differences, and they still think you hung the moon.
It is not always a problem finding the truth, it is however sometimes a problem accepting it.
Different people have different ways of defining, living and maintaining relationships. Your way is not the only right way, it is merely your way. As far as right way is concerned, there isn't any. It is all about different opinions and perceptions.
I don't know what to say to fill the silence. I don't know how to fix this. It seems wrong to leave him, but I have to. There's no compromise, no alternative. Things just weren't meant to be, which seems like a pansy-ass thing to say, until it happens to you.
But even so, I wondered--how well do we really ever know someone?
My brother, Langston, said, “Lily, you don’t understand because you’ve never been in love. If you had a boyfriend, you’d understand.” Langston has a new boyfriend and all I understand from that is a sorry state of co-dependence.
males conspicuously leaving their mark to let others know where they weren't welcome.
Could it possibly be that he yearned for some of the same things she yearned for? Love. Someone to call your own. Someone to share the joys and the sorrows of life.
All I know is that the closer I get to God, the deeper I get into the Bible, and the heavier the burden seems on my shoulders.
Relationships should be like glass .... No matter who sees from what angel .... It should be transparent
You know what she's made of." "Yeah, good stock, good breeding, a hard head and a hunger to win." She flashed him a smile as they approached the kitchen door. "I've been told that describes me. I'm half Irish, Brian, I was born stubborn." "No arguing with that. A person might make the world a calmer place for others by being passive, but you don't get very far in it yourself, do you?" "Look at that. We have a foundation of agreement. Now tell me you like spaghetti and meatballs." "It happens to be a favorite of mine." "That's handy. Mine, too. And I heard a rumor that's what's for dinner." She reached for the doorknob, then caught him off guard by brushing a light kiss over his lips. "And since we'll be joining my parents, it would probably be best if you didn't imagine me naked for the next couple of hours." She sailed in ahead of him, leaving Brian helplessly and utterly aroused.
You have to be quite heavily invested in someone to do them the honour of telling them you're annoyed with them.
... the best way of killing a rose is to force it open when it is still only the promise of a bud.
Give her the continent and she wanted the hemisphere.
Something snapped inside her. “Of course I’m afraid! Relationships do bad things to me.” He started to respond, but the pain had gone on long enough, and she didn’t want to hear it. “You know what I want? I want peace. I want a good job and a decent place to live. I want to read books and listen to music and have time to make some female friendships that are going to last. When I wake up in the morning, I want to know that I have a decent shot at being happy. And here’s what’s really sad. Until I met you, I was almost there.
The best foundation for relationships to grow, flourish, and succeed is a deep-rooted friendship.
A certain amount of volatility and drama can me healthy and keep things fun and interesting if you're willing at any moment during a fight to say, 'This means nothing. I love you, let's forget about it.
Conflict can and should be handled constructively; when it is, relationships benefit. Conflict avoidance is *not* the hallmark of a good relationship. On the contrary, it is a symptom of serious problems and of poor communication.
Tenderness emerges from the fact that the two persons, longing, as all individuals do, to overcome the separateness and isolation to which we are all heir because we are individuals, can participate in a relationship that, for the moment, is not of two isolated selves but a union
And you? Now that I have discovered you? Beautiful, dangerous, unleashed. Still I try to hold you, knowing that your body is faced with knives.
Definition of a relationship - an enduring, mutually-agreed upon connection or union, which fulfills certain needs of the individuals involved and the society in which they live.
This is the list you carry in your pocket, of the things you plan to say to Kay, when you find him, if you find him:  1. I’m sorry that I forgot to water your ferns while you were away that time. 2. When you said that I reminded you of your mother, was that a good thing? 3. I never really liked your friends all that much. 4. None of my friends ever really liked you. 5. Do you remember when the cat ran away, and I cried and cried and made you put up posters, and she never came back? I wasn’t crying because she didn’t come back. I was crying because I’d taken her to the woods, and I was scared she’d come back and tell you what I’d done, but I guess a wolf got her, or something. She never liked me anyway. 6. I never liked your mother. 7. After you left, I didn’t water your plants on purpose. They’re all dead. 8. Goodbye. 9. Were you ever really in love with me? 10. Was I good in bed, or just average? 11. What exactly did you mean, when you said that it was fine that I had put on a little weight, that you thought I was even more beautiful, that I should go ahead and eat as much as I wanted, but when I weighed myself on the bathroom scale, I was exactly the same weight as before, I hadn’t gained a single pound? 12. So all those times, I’m being honest here, every single time, and anyway I don’t care if you don’t believe me, I faked every orgasm you ever thought I had. Women can do that, you know. You never made me come, not even once. 13. So maybe I’m an idiot, but I used to be in love with you. 14. I slept with some guy, I didn’t mean to, it just kind of happened. Is that how it was with you? Not that I’m making any apologies, or that I’d accept yours, I just want to know. 15. My feet hurt, and it’s all your fault. 16. I mean it this time, goodbye.
Being honest in a relationship is at times exceedingly difficult and painful. Yet the moment a person evades the truth, central fibers of the self pull away and the person initiates a process of deception - a way of manipulating the other person by preventing the person from discovering "real thoughts and real feelings
Because, Jack, you volunteered to be taken down into eternal torment in place of her. This is the absolute <i>minimum</i> (unless I'm mistaken) that any female requires from her man.
Love will never let you down, if you don't give it up
I shall now explain my plan. You may then speak, but only to amend the detail. The broad outline is not subject to negotiation. Are you ready? Good … I propose to have sex with you. I believe it will be excellent sex. Your obedience on one particular issue of timing it will be required to make it unforgettable sex. I will explain that issue as we go. At the moment, I wish to hear your inevitable objection to the general sex part of this plan.
did you ever think the reason you haven't found the right man is because it's not your time? Sometimes God kets bad things happen to us as a sign that something is not right. He also does it to make us stronger. God got a plan for you, and you gotta stop fighting it. Focus on YOU, and let God lead that man to you.
How we perceive, feel about and respond to people and situations is far more guided by the lessons of early childhood than we would like to believe. We may be adults, chronologically and physically, but too often the youngest parts of our personality are invisibly, yet actively, living our lives.
Once," Fran says, settling against the worktable, folding her arms, "I knew this kid who very bravely and bossily came out of the closet when she was only fourteen years old. She told me then that we can't choose who we love. We just love the people we love, no mattter what anyone else might want for us. Wasn't that you?
A relationship could be a place to hide too.
Honor your relationships by developing listening skills.
One of the most astounding dynamics in human relationships is how the unconscious intuition of our brain's right hemisphere is able to act as radar to find us just the right person to provoke and recreate our childhood attachment relationship ...I've given much thought to the question of why we are designed to be drawn -like a moth to a flame- to the very person who is most likely to resurrect all our childhood anguish. It seems like a cruel hoax to play on two wounded souls.
Polyamorous people are wary of having others' values inflicted upon themselves, and so tend to stay very far away from making such pronouncements, to the point that they will actively ignore predatory behavior that is affecting their own "community.
I read once that sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks ahead.
In a culture of diversity, one group is likely not "just like everyone else." To deny that we have different needs, concerns, thought processes, worldview, is to refuse to look at the reason we are supposedly an identifiable community.
It is possible to compromise in certain areas when choosing a partner for life, but never on a cravat.
When you think of it, people may rub elbows and still have an ocean or two between them.
We've come a long way from the time when the crowning achievement in a woman's life was her youthful marriage. And many would agree that this represents progress for women. But when did the search for someone to marry become self-absorbed and pathetic? This absence of social sympathy for women's ambitions to marry is all the more striking because the social world has cared so deeply about virtually every other aspect of these privileged young women's inner and outer lives. (...) The achievement of a good marriage is the one area of life where the most privileged, accomplished, and high achieving young women in society face a loss of support and sympathy for their ambitions and where the social expectations are for disappointment and failure, not success.
I know how bad you boys feel, but the sun will still come up tomorrow. And when it does, you 'll feel better. When the sun comes up the day after tomorrow, a little better still. This is just a part of your life, and it's over. It would have been better to win, but either way, it's over. Life will go on.
When it comes to relationships, I find it best to have two feet out the door
We men are fascinated by the things we don't really understand. It gives us something to think and talk about: like females, they drive us nuts.
LADY BRACKNELL  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.
I think it's the same with all the relationships between a man and a woman. They can survive anything so long as some kind of basic humanity exists between the two people. When all kindness has gone, when one person obviously and sincerely doesn't care if the other is alive or dead, then it's just no good.  -- from Quantum of Solace
schools for love do not exist. everyone assumes that we will know how to love instinctively. despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, we still accept that the family is the primary school for love. those of us who do not learn how to love among family are expected to experience love in romantic relationships. however this love often eludes us.
Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.
Because of that she had never had enough energy to be herself, a person who, like everyone else in the world, needed other people in order to be happy. But other people were so difficult. They reacted in unpredictable ways, they surrounded themselves with defensive walls, they behaved just as she did, pretending they didn't care about anything. When someone more open to life appeared, they either rejected them outright or made them suffer, consigning them to being inferior, ingenuous.
Some cynical Frenchman has said that there are two parties to a love-transaction: the one who loves and the other who condescends to be so treated.
A rewarding relationship occurs when there is a common spiritual goal, shared spiritual values and a mutual desire to build a relationship upon a spiritual foundation and for the purpose of connecting to the light of the creator.
If I loved someone, I could never let him go away from me. I would be too miserable and lonely.
Life, weddings, relationships, road trips, gardening, making out, haircuts: few of the fun things in life always go as expected.
Why are poets so apt to choose their mates, not for any similarity of poetic endowment, but for qualities which might make the happiness of the rudest handicraftsman as well as that of the ideal craftsman of the spirit? Because, probably, at his highest elevation, the poet needs no human intercourse; but he finds it dreary to descend, and be a stranger.
I wouldn't have cared if my girlfriend was a Jaguar-driving Cyclops with a beard - I'd have been grateful just to have someone to make out with.
Was Deirdre right about me purposely wanting relationships that were impossible?
In the world I lived in, the world of human people, there were ties and debts and consequences and good deeds. That was what bound people to society; maybe that was what constituted society. And I tried to live in my little niche in it the best way I could.
Okay, then, what was he like? Just give me something to go on so that I have a shot at him!' 'A shot at him? Are you on an elk hunt?
In our relationship, we have very well-defined roles: I am the Vice President of Logistics; he's the CEO of Emotional Support.
Hope is putting Faith "on the line" and expecting results!  (from Mission Possible - Spiritual Covering)
I slid down in the seat and began to weep. I wept for her, for me, but mostly because the siren call of my first big story with a yellow border around it was more powerful than the call of fatherhood.
I had an absurd desire to go down to her and make sure she was all right, and stay with her until dawn. I also had a fierce wish to bludgeon the two frat boys to death with a shovel.
Even now, he is every blue blazer getting into cab, every runner along the river,every motorcycle coming and going.
Relationships are physics. Time transforms things- it has to, because the change from me to we means clearing away the fortifications you'r put up around your old personality. Living with Susannah made me feel as if I started riding Einstein's famous theoretical bus. Here's my understanding of that difficult idea, nutshelled: if you're riding a magic Greyhound, equipped for light-speed travel, you'll actually live though less time than will any pedestrians whom the bus passes by. So, for a neighbor on the street with a stopwatch, the superfast bus will take two hours to travel from Point A to Point B. But where you're on that Greyhound, and looking at the wipe of the world out those rhomboidial coach windows, the same trip will take just under twenty-four minutes. Your neighbor, stopwatch under thumb, will have aged eighty-six percent more than you have. It's hard to fathom. But I think it's exactly what adult relationships do to us: on the outside, years pass, lives change. But inside, it's just a day that repeats. You and your partner age at the same clip; it seems not time has gone by. Only when you look up from your relationship- when you step off the bus, feel the ground under your shoes- do you sense the sly, soft absurdity of romance physics.
Naturally, I do blame Françoise. I blame her for having N in the first place. She was young, she was beautiful, she was married to a doctor, and she was intelligent. She could have abstained from producing her first son. It was wrong on a variety of levels.
In advising the heads of state to learn from tragedy rather than perpetuate its existence Robert Kennedy excalimed, "Tragedy is a tool for the living to gain wisdom, not a guide by which to live." We have a tendency to dwell on tragedy and use it as a justification for tragic occurrences that follow,rather than parse the tragedy, taking from it important lessons and using those lessons to avoid similar tragedies.
The heart of a person only beats when it's surrounded by blood, by family.
I write with the entire alphabet, not just the popular letters.  Readers don't want to lose themselves in the text. They want to find themselves in it.
Cáel sighed. “Look, right now? Either you want Rose, or you don’t. If you do—and, quite frankly, it’s obvious to me that you do—then give the woman a break and give yourself some credit for not being a whack job. Women are strange creatures, Gray, and she isn’t a mind reader. Who the hell knows what kind of conclusions she’s drawn over your behavior? Shit or get off the pot.”  It was a good thing Gray wasn’t drinking anything, or he’d have choked on that one. “<em>That’s</em> your advice on love? ‘Shit or get off the pot’?
Although I notice there is never a truly good time to have a nice long chat with one´s mother-in-law, unless you are having an extraordinary life and marriage and your mother-in-law is, say, Maureen Dowd, or Indira Gandhi. Someone of that ilk.
When I meet a woman whose energy falters at the first barrier,she seems to fade beside my mother.
They're horrible little creatures. All snot and smelly feet and pestering questions."  "Then why did you go into teaching?"  "It was either that or sit at home with Mother all day. I picked the lesser of two evils.
Très, très, triste...
You can know a thing to death and be for all purposes completely ignorant of it. A man can know his father, or his son, and there might still be nothing between them but loyalty and love and mutual incomprehension.
They say you are not you except in terms of relation to other people. If there weren't any other people there wouldn't be any you because what you do, which is what you are, only has meaning in relation to other people.
Après trois ans, un couple doit se quitter, se suicider, ou faire des enfants, ce qui sont trois façons d'entériner sa fin.
The trouble is, I can't find a part of myself where you're not important. I write in order to be worth your while and to finance the way I want to live with you. Not the way you want to live. The way I want to live with you. Without you I wouldn't care. I'd eat tinned spaghetti and put on yesterday's clothes. But as it is I change my socks, and make money, and tart up Brodie's unspeakable drivel into speakable drivel so he can be an author too, like me.
Many aspects of our screen-bound lives are bad for our social skills simply because we get accustomed to controlling the information that comes in, managing our relationships electronically, deleting stuff that doesn't interest us. We edit the world; we select from menus; we pick and choose; our social 'group' focuses on us and disintegrates without us. This makes it rather confusing for us when we step outdoors and discover that other people's behaviour can't be deleted with a simple one-stroke command or dragged to the trash icon.
While the primary function of formal Buddhist meditation is to create the possibility of the experience of "being," my work as a therapist has shown me that the demands of intimate life can be just as useful as meditation in moving people toward this capacity. Just as in formal meditation, intimate relationships teach us that the more we relate to each other as objects, the greater our disappointment. The trick, as in meditation, is to use this disappointment to change the way we relate.
...I try to incorporate life's lessons from everyone around me and pay it forward anytime I can. I look at every person I meet as a new and thrilling experience with which I'm gifted. Every new city or country or continent that I visit is a beautiful exploration from which I can learn. Every new client or project represents the possibility of meeting new people and having new adventures.
Everybody is taken in at some period or another. [...] In marriage especially. [...] There is not one in a hundred of either sex, who is not taken in when they marry. Look where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be so, when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expect most from others, and are least honest with themselves.
Suddenly the thought that the end of her life was imminent shocked him; it was one thing to pity someone he didn't know, quite another to face the same dilemma with someone he knew intimately. That was the trouble with beds. They turned strangers into intimates more quickly than ten years of polite teas in parlours.
More than anything I wish he were here with me. "A relationship is an accumulation of shared history," he'd said to me once. And here I was making history without him. It's lonely. And I can't wait to go home. Parts of me are showing through my Aqua, and I'm having a hard time keeping them separate.
You have made him live.
We have to live like people in a web of knives, we mustn't reach out our hands or we get them gashed.
I am sorry the only outlet for her troubled mind was in clumsy foreplay with an inadequate partner."  He threw the rest of her sandwich at the swinging door as she passed through it.
You’re my princess, right? You were always going to be my princess, no matter what you were born, no matter who your dad married.
How do I feel today? I feel as unfit as an unfiddle, And it is the result of a certain turbulence in the mind and an uncertain burbulence in the middle. What was it, anyway, that angry thing that flew at me? I am unused to banshees crying Boo at me. Your wife can’t be a banshee— Or can she?
I have produced no children of my own and my husband is dead," she replied, an acid tone in her voice. "Thus I am more to be pitied than revered. I am expected to give up the shop to my nephew, who will then be able to afford to bring a very good wife from Pakistan. In exchange, I will be given houseroom and no doubt, the honor of taking care of several small children of other family members."  The Major was silent. He was at once appalled and also reluctant to hear any more. This was why people usually talked about the weather.
There was no singles problem until singles got so single-minded that they stopped wasting time with anyone ineligible. Before that, it was understood that one of society's main tasks was matchmaking. People with lifelong friendships and ties to local nonprofessional organizations did not have to fear that isolation would accompany retirement, old age, or losing a spouse. Overburdened householders could count on the assistance not only of their own extended families, but of the American tradition of neighborliness.
Relationships are about taking off the mask you wear to make someone like you and letting them see the real you. The one you hid all the time. The one you never thought was good enough to find love in the first place.
Maybe he was old-fashioned, but to him a couple meant a strong bond, with positive and negative charges constantly arcing between them.
My Miracle, living through a Traumatic brain Injury
She wrote a long letter on a short piece of paper
Can I have a glass of water?" Her voice was hoarse, probably from screaming. She'd always sounded like that after they'd-  He didn't just force the thought aside. He clubbed it unconscious, threw it into a crawl space and walled it up alive.
In the long history of male and female relations all the way back to the Garden, I can't think of one in which a woman's anger ever won over a man.
On se réconcilie avec un ennemi qui nous est inférieur pour les qualités du coeur ou de l'esprit ; on ne pardonne jamais à celui qui nous surpasse par l'âme et le génie.
...it is not always possible to restore one’s boundaries after they have been blurred and made permeable by a relationship: try as we might, we cannot reconstitute ourselves as the autonomous beings we previously imagined ourselves to be. Something of us is now outside, and something of the outside is now within us.
Each store will fulfil some of your needs, but no individual store can meet all of your needs. Learning how to set realistic expectations now and in future relationships requires you to examine each of the existing stores to see what they can offer.
I know the you who’s in the margins. I know you’re thinking hard about what you want and why– more than some people ever do. I know you can take on a challenge and kick its ass. And I know you’ve tried harder to understand me than anyone has in a long time.
She: So where do we go from here? He: Nowhere! She: What do you mean? He: You go your way and I go mine! She: Can we have a future together? He: I don't settle down! I am the wanderer and wandering is my destiny!
There is a depth to life which only comes from our connection to other people. However, we have to find it without becoming a prisoner.
Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.
It's ok to be a fool once or twice but never let it be a third time. Be smart and pretend to be a fool and at the end of the hunt make sure you're the one that has the gun.
Claiming to love self, but willingly default to cheating at the first sign of trouble is nothing short of playing yourself. Your ego may feel avenged - temporarily - but your heart and soul, the true self, will suffer the long term affects of karma's justifiable sting.
I am not looking for a "perfect" man. Only one who matches me on an emotional, spiritual, sexual, and intellectual level.
It's hard to experience desire when you're weighted down by concern.
Doing something later is not automatically the same as doing something better
If you stand right at the edge of the night sky, some place where one o’clock leaves to meet two, the breeze will carry your words up to the stars. And they’ll swallow your secrets until its time to hand them over to the truths in the sky- the ones that draw maps in the black.   They carve their answers into the backs of my hands, the grooves of the words running deep in my palms.
One thing I have come to realize is that love is not always happiness.
Sometimes we place faith in the wrong people for the right reasons. We're too blind to their faults, and they're too blind to appreciate us. —Brighton Hayes
It's probably not easy for a woman to understand what it's like to be a man. Imagine you're starving, and someone puts a huge buffet in front of you. There's delicious, mouth-watering food all around you, and it's really really hard not to eat it all. That's what it's like to be a man around attractive women. The urge to want to hump everything that moves is part of a man's natural programming. It's a deep-seated hunger. To suppress that hunger takes civilization and a lot of willpower.
Being in a relationship with some people is like pushing a boat through sand. I used to have the time and energy for that kind of nonsense, but not anymore. Relationships should be a wonderful journey of exploration and love; not grinding resistance.
The idea that we can be exactly what the other desires is a powerful fantasy.
You know what I love? The spaces between I love you. The tap of your fork against the plate and how my cup of wine clicks against our table. The scratchy voice coming from the radio in the other room. The quiet sound of your hand reaching across the table and whispering over mine. How your voice sounds like your mouth on the back of my neck. The soft murmur of our easy conversation.  Between these quiet Tuesday night routines, following every comma and right after every pause for breath, is I, love, and you. In the middle of every I love you is a sink full of dishes, whisper of socked feet tangled in white sheets, and gentle kisses against curved cheeks. We lyric ourselves into the laundry that needs to be finished, into the ends of every smile that follows me repeating your name. We write ourselves into the grocery bags we need to carry, the cracks running up our rented walls, the sides of the bed we choose to drag up the sails of heavy eyed dreams.  Like the spaces between our fingers, in the spaces between I, love, and you, we wait.  The in-betweens have always been my favorite.
I had begun to feel that life was a repetition of the same thing; that there was nothing new either in me or in him; and that, on the contrary, we kept going back as it were on what was old.
And me, standing under the splintered night,  catching fractured glimpses into the black behind the black,  hearing the prayers of stars, the angry whispers of the dark summer night.  Its voice cracks, on your name.  My eyes close, on your name.
Fine! He is being passive aggressive with me, and it's gonna backfire; I'm gonna be active friendly.
It's the in-between, the sustenance, not just the gears and bolts that make a human. When you forget to find out how the person was built—the oil, chemistry, and the craft—you miss all the beauty.
More than nakedness, for there is no cover to take. The fire in your eyes is ringed with water; wide and cool. We are far from the brutal place, but you do not think so. You take my hand  and disappear like you were never there,  except that I am now somewhere else.
Be honest. This applies to every area of your life. Sketchiness is not an attractive trait. No more trying to cover up your baggage, sweeping things under the rug, withholding truth, blatant lying, or even telling seemingly ‘harmless’ white lies or half-truths – release the need to lie completely! Start NOW.
We draw into our life those who will help us to grow. Naturally, we tend to have mixed feelings about those very people but they are marked for us. We have forgotten that we wrote them an invitation some time ago. We look at them as if they are intruders when all along they are our guests.
Tell them there are no holes for your fingers in the masks of men. Tell them how could you ever even hope to love what you can't grab onto.
We have already said more goodbyes than are necessary. Those were goodbyes that brought about the end of partings. We taught each other that no parting is possible.
You can turn every ugly and damaging drama into a genuine blessing by seeing it differently. No one is suffering on purpose. We learn to give up the pleasure we feel in self-righteously blaming others. Healing happens when we see things differently. The question is: do you want suffering or peace? It's that simple.
Every grievance you hold hides a little more of the light of the world from your eyes until the darkness becomes overwhelming. Everything you forgive restores that light. So ask yourself, who is it that you are really hurting?
If one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child, then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty.
Cultivating loving kindness for ourselves is the foundation of real love for our friends and family, for new people we encounter in our daily lives, for all beings and for life itself.
No crime is a means to an end. No crime can be rationalized.
I want to tell [him] everything - everything that has ever happened to me, every observation I have ever had, and I want to share every book, song, or movie I have ever loved
If one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child, then one million of you are a million times guilty.
If love isn't there, nothing will grow. If it is, there is always hope and it will win in the end. Love is vital and sacrosanct.
I'm tired of being inside my head. I want to live out here, with you.
You will say good-bye for all the right reasons. You're tired of living in wait for his apocalypse. You have your own fight on your hands, and though it's no bigger or more noble than his, it will require all of your energy.  It's you who has to hold on to earth. You have to tighten your grip -- which means letting go of him.
What's the use of complaining about something you have no intentions of changing it?
It is harder, usually, to find a person who wants to walk the streets of me, to taste the teas of my country, to... immigrate, you could say.
... relationships required such vigilance, such attention. You had to hold them together by force of will, and other people took up so much space, demanded so much time. It was exhausting.
I hope you read this, whoever you are, and imagine that there is a hypothetical person out there who needs your love, has been waiting silently, patiently for it all his life, is flawed and downright ugly at times and yet would have just eaten up any tiny bit of affection you had been willing to give, had you ever stopped your own happy life to notice. And then imagine that this hypothetical person is real, because he probably is.... Wish I’d met you. Wish I wasn’t your hypothetical. But you’re reading this, which means a few minutes ago, I went into that bathroom and pulled the trigger. You probably heard it. Sorry. You’re welcome. Thank you. And please. Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
I'm always looking for what will make me whole. What will make me happy? Somewhere along the way I started to think it wasn't Helen anymore. She hasn't changed. Her laugh is still the one I remember. Her finger is still the one I put the ring on all those years ago. I can't understand why I don't want to curve next to her, keep her back warm anymore. Surely you don't lose love like keys?
People change us. It is a rare, if not an impossible occurrence, that we come out of relationships unscathed. In our dealings with people we take something with us and we leave something behind. Some people are haunted more than others, either by the sweet perfume of another or the stink of regret.
Time grants a unique perspective which allows us to see events through a filter of accumulated wisdom.
There are moments in relationship when you didn't speak, you didn't have to; but you talked a lot.
All men are born firstly with the instinct to protect themselves. But few grow to really love themselves, and even fewer learn to love their neighbor as themselves.
I knew her so well that I loved her, or maybe I loved her so well that I knew her. I didn't want to fight her anymore. I wanted to quit. I wanted to go home. So I blew up her planet.
For the life of me I cannot remember, what made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise. For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen.
That’s the thing about love  It can take you up to the mountaintop and can drop you  And the impact will either kill you or make you a new person
If you behave in a manner that poisons your relationship, don’t be surprised when it dies.
I spent half my childhood trying to be like my dad. True for most boys, I think. It turns with adolescence. The last thing I wanted was to be like my dad. It took becoming a man to realize how lucky I’d been. It took a few hard knocks in life to make me realize the only thing my dad had ever wanted or worked for was to give me a chance at being better than him.
They shared a laugh, and then the silence that so often intruded on their discussion asserted itself once again, a gap born of equal parts weariness, familiarity and--conversely--the many differences that fate had created between those who had once gone about lives that were but variations on a single melody.
I never told her the other story, in which she stars, in which she is always the heroine – a romanticized story full of cliché images in which I am telling her all the things there has not been enough time for, in which we are doing all the things there has not been time for…
i want to say to her: i just want to be myself. and i want to be with someone who's just himself. that's all. i want to see through all the performance and all the pretending and get right to the truth.
because in the past words have only driven them apart.
The Auden/Kallman relationship had this to be said for it: It affirmed that it's better to be blatant than latent.
If one does not make an ego out of gender, one would still know whether one is a man or a woman, gay, straight, bisexual, transgender—whatever else we may think of. But those identities need to fit very loosely and be worn very lightly. All sense of privilege or deprivation that has developed around one’s gender identity, all rigidity regarding proper roles and behaviors for the various genders, must be cut through.
I don’t have cookie-cutter relationships, Rumi. Women aren’t iPhone apps that I download and discard!
I think this is why Ellis took so many moving pictures of us. Because he knew that people come in and out of your life, and a picture fixes them in the moment they reach out to you.
The greater part of a men who speak ill of women are speaking of a certain woman.
There was once a spirited feral mustang broken in by her stern rider. It was a harmonious relationship for the most part but, like any relationship, she tested the boundaries he placed on her and threw him...Would the rider, having suffered his own wound, retaliate, discipline or forgive?
You can have a pet zebra and put that zebra into a small cage every day and tell the zebra that you love it, but no matter how you and the zebra love each other, the fact remains, that the zebra should be let out of that cage and should belong to someone who can treat it better, the way it should be treated, someone who can make it happy.
When jealousy rears up, it indicates that something inside of you is afraid. It's an alarm, nothing less and nothing more. Treat it as such.
I took it for granted that there must be a few men left in the world who had that kind of strength. I assumed that those men would also be looking for women with principle. I did not want to be among the marked-down goods on the bargain table, cheap because they’d been pawed over. Crowds collect there. It is only the few who will pay full price. "You get what you pay for.
When we do the hard, intimate work of friendship, we bring a little more of the divine into daily life.
So, a little advice. Relax. You're not filling a job position. You're looking for a pleasant acquaintance.. who might become a good friend... who turns out to be attractive to your senses... and a rewarding lover... then a committed partner whose heart will not stray. If you don't see those signposts and in that order, then you're probably on the wrong road and getting more lost with every step.
The only humility that is really ours is not that which we try to show before God in prayer, but that which we carry with us, and carry out, in our ordinary conduct; the insignficances of daily life are the importances and the tests of eternity, because they prove what really is the spirit that possesses us.
One as deformed and horrible as myself, could not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species, and have the same defects... with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being...
When you begin with the premise "I treat everyone equally," you have already blinkered yourself from seeing where you don't, or can't, or shouldn't. There is no way to treat two people equally, because they are each unique, with respective strengths and weaknesses.
Let them see that you trust them &amp; let them solve their own problems, make their own decisions.Do that &amp; they will commit their lives to you. Bully the, control them out of fear or malice or just for your own convenience, &amp; after a while you'll have to spend all your time thinking for them, controlling them, &amp; stifling their resentment.
Build me up and I with you. For we are more one than two.
I will be on the look out for you, my dear girl," he wrote. "You must expect to give yourself up when you come." For this buttoned-up age, for Burnham, it was a letter that could have steamed itself open.
Men, being accustomed to act on reflection themselves, are a great deal too apt to believe that women act on reflection, too. Women do nothing of the sort. They act on impulse; and, in nine cases out of ten, they are heartily sorry for it afterward.
...it is never safe to classify the souls of one's neighbors; one is apt, in the long run, to be proved a fool. You should regard each meeting with a friend as a sitting he is unwillingly giving you for a portrait -- a portrait that, probably, when you or he die, will still be unfinished. And, though this is an absorbing pursuit, nevertheless, the painters are apt to end pessimists. For however handsome and merry may be the face, however rich the background, in the first rough sketch of each portrait, yet with every added stroke of the brush, with every tiny readjustment of the 'values,' with every modification of the chiaroscuro, the eyes looking out at you grow more disquieting. And, finally, it is your <i>own</i> face that you are staring at in terror, as in a mirror by candle-light, when all the house is still.
Use every opportunity of humbling yourself before your fellow-men as a help to abide humble before God.
I would see him, Edward.' It was no request; he knew it to be an ultimatum. He shook his head violently, not trusting his voice. Time passed. She was staring at him, saying nothing, and on her face was a look of stunned disbelief, of anguished accusation he knew would haunt him for the rest of his life. But when she spoke, her voice held no hint of tears. It was not a voice to offer either understanding or absolution, spoke of no quarter given, of a lifetime of love denied. 'God may forgive you for this,' she said, very slowly and distinctly, 'but I never shall.
At first, you fall in love. You wake in the morning woozy and your twilight is lit with astral violet light. You spelunk down into each other until you come to possess some inner vision of each other that becomes one thing. Us. Together. And time passes. Like the forming of Earth itself, volcanoes rise and spew lava. Oceans appear. Rock plates shift. Sea turtles swim half the ocean to lay eggs on the mother island; songbirds migrate over continents for berries from a tree. You evolve--cosmically and geologically. You lose each other and find each other again. Every day. Until love gathers the turtles and the birds of your world and encompasses them, too.
Relationships tend to be flawed because they are made up of inherently flawed components, mere human beings.
I knew I was waiting for someone I didn't understand.
Your words like wings gravity they defy. My heart like a leaf on the wind catchin' rides. We make too much sense to foolishly pass it by. So I'm taking a rainbow up to the 5th floor. Steppin' out to see that you're really worth more.
In a sane world, a term like "chronic crisis" would be instantly seen by anone as an oxymoron. Nevertheless, that's the state that many of us Western Worlders live in, provoking crisis after crisis so that we can justify our dis-ease rather than addressing that directly.
I could tell you of occasionally, every eon, meeting a person, with whom I might stay for a billion years. But what of it? After a billion years there is nothing left to say, and you wander apart, uncaring in the end.
He ran his fingers over the moist ends of her hair and across her face. Her eyes were wet. <i>Jesus Christ.</i> How many nights had he heard Lily crying. As some parents sleep through fire, thunderstorms, and voices at the back door only to wake at a child’s whisper, so Everett heard Lily crying at night. Her muffled sobs seemed to have broken his dreams for years. He had heard her even at Fort Lewis, even in Georgia, finally at Bliss. That was Lily crying in the wings whenever the priest came to tear up his mother’s grave. Lily cried in the twilight field where he picked wild poppies with Martha; Lily’s was the cry he heard those nights the kiln burned, the levee broke, the ranch went to nothing.
But men and women are different in the way that they feel loved. Men like to be admired for what they do, for their integrity and their accomplishments, whether it’s at work or at the gym or mowing the lawn, because it makes them feel manly. When a woman tells a man that she is proud of him, or she tells him that he did a good job, he’ll about bend over backwards to take care of her and love her.”    “But women like attention from men, because it makes them feel feminine and adored. That’s why they’re always fixin’ themselves up, doing their hair, wearing pretty clothes and makeup and jewelry and perfume. It’s all to attract your attention, you know.” (Thelma Jenkins)
I long ago developed a very practical smile, which I call my "Noh smile" because it resembles a Noh mask whose features are frozen. Its advantage is that men can interpret it however they want; you can imagine how often I've relied on it.
But we'd only had so many nights together, and the notebook had so many pages, and the world was never going to get bigger.
Learning the difference between God's intervention, the devil's mischief, and PMS can lead to increased happiness.
...we are taught to put fun and serious pursuits on a continuum as opposed extremes, when this dichotomy is entirely false, made even worse when we act as though we can instantly exchange one for the other...Exerting yourself at a task that is serious and rewarding can still be quite fun, but doing something fun because you have a neurotic need to pack your life full of un is pretty much a guarantee that any long-term benefits you derive will be entirely happenstance.
There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.
But I want to see Clara, Charlie's friend, who's right up my street. I want to see her because I don't know where my street is; I don't even know which part of town it's in, which city, which country, so maybe she'll enable me to get my bearings.
Sabrina Thomas clutched the leather-bound notebook to her chest and tried not to be impatient as the elevator in the south tower of Texas Hospital near downtown Dallas stopped once again on its climb to the eighteenth and top floor. But it was difficult. Dr. Cade Mathis, the bane of her existence, would reach Mrs. Ward’s room first and then there’d be hell to pay. Sabrina jabbed the button to close the doors as soon as the last person stepped onto the already crowded elevator.
But nearly every woman I know has a roughly similar story - in fact, dozens of them: stories about being obsessed with a celebrity, work colleague or someone they vaguely knew for years; living in a parallel world in their head; conjuring up endless plots and scenarios for this thing that never actually happened.
To the immature, other people are not real.
She serves me a piece of it a few minutes out of the oven. A little steam rises from the slits on top. Sugar and spice - cinnamon - burned into the crust. But she's wearing these dark glasses in the kitchen at ten o'clock in the morning - everything nice - as she watches me break off a piece, bring it to my mouth, and blow on it. My daughter's kitchen, in winter. I fork the pie in and tell myself to stay out of it. She says she loves him. No way could it be worse.
It suddenly struck me that Dawsey is a lonesome person. I think it may be that he has always been lonely, but he didn't mind before, and now he minds.
We are raised to believe (on the surface, at least) that us humans only have so much love to give, and that it comes in a standard round unit: one. After all, we associate love with the heart, and, well, you've either got a whole heart, or you're dead, period. You can't, common wisdom goes, just run around dividing that one heart up freely; to claim to do so means that you're either a fool, or you're dividing up something that is dead.
Dear 2600: I think my girlfriend has been cheating on me and I wanted to know if I could get her password to Hotmail and AOL. I am so desperate to find out. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.   And this is yet another popular category of letter we get. You say any help would be appreciated? Let’s find out if thats true. Do you think someone who is cheating on you might also be capable of having a mailbox you don’t know about? Do you think that even if you could get into the mailbox she uses that she would be discussing her deception there, especially if we live in a world where Hotmail and AOL passwords are so easily obtained? Finally, would you feel better if you invaded her privacy and found out that she was being totally honest with you? Whatever problems are going on in this relationship are not going to be solved with subterfuge. If you can’t communicate openly, there’s not much there to salvage.
It's a false premise to say that most monogamous people have chosen monogamy. Most people belong to the religion they were raised in...because that's what's familiar. That's the milieu they grew up in, and, for better or worse, they're just continuing the pattern. Until this traditionalist mindset is shaken loose, you would likely try from reflex to impose notions onto nonmonogamy that are not only untenable in the new context but spel sudden and messy doom even in situations that otherwise could be worked out.
It's your world, but I make my way in it. At fifteen, no, I couldn't stand up to you. The age of illusions, when we know nothing, we hope for everything; we're wandering in a mist ... And the half of the world that's never had any use for us, suddenly is besieging us. You <i>need</i> us, you <i>adore</i> us, you're suffering for us. You want everything--except to know what we think. You look deep in our eyes--and put your hand up our dress. You call us, <i>"Pretty thing."</i> That confuses us. The most beautiful woman, the highest ranked, lives half dazzled by constant attention, half stifled by obvious contempt. We think all we're good for is pleasing you--till one day, long acquaintance with you dispels the last mist. In a clear light, we suddenly see you as you are--and generally we start preferring ourselves. At thirty, I could finally say no--or really say yes. That's when you begin backing away from us. Now I'm full-grown. I pursue my happiness the same as any man.
Polyamory is differentiable from some other forms of nonmonogamy (including adultery) in that it is future-oriented. Poly relationships are not located solely in the moment, but have intentions (though perhaps tacit and vaguely defined) of at least adding to a base of experience possibly so far as signifying a life-long and emotionally attached commitment.
Beside her, she can feel each breath he draws. How is it possible to be so close to a person and still not know what you are to each other? With baseball, it's simple. There's no mystery to what happens on the field because everything has a label -- full count, earned run, perfect game -- and there's a certain amount of comfort in this terminology. There's no room for confusion and Ryan wishes now that everything could be so straightforward. But then Nick pulls her closer, and she rests her head on his chest, and nothing seems more important that this right here.
She had searched for just the right guy; sensitive and gentle and willing to wait. Quite a long search, of course. She was looking for some imaginary man who cared more about having someone to talk to and see movies with than he needed to have sex, because she was just Not Ready for That.  Did I say imaginary? Well yes. Human men are not like that.
The red firelight glowed on their two bonny heads and revealed their faces, animated with the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel, and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.
...whenever a woman describes a man as sweet, the dalliance is doomed.
All I can think is that I want her more than anything. I want her more than I've ever wanted anything, ever.
Mom actually said that?" Cassie's face shown with happiness. "She always hated my math!"  "Nah," Martin said. "She was just being that way for you. She thought it was what you needed to hear. If parents told us what they really think about stuff, we could figure them out like regular people.
Time for us began to be measured by moments when we spoke, and moments when we longed to speak again.
I do not know, at this point, whether Joshua Joseph Spork is the man of my life. He could be. I have given it considerable thought. The jury is still out. The issue between you and me is that you wish to deprive me of the opportunity to find out. Joe Spork is not yours to give or to withhold from me, Mr. Cummerbund. He is <em>mine</em>, until I decide otherwise. You have caused him grief, sullied his name, and you have hurt him. If anyone is going to make him weep, or lie about him, or even do bad things to him, it is <em>me</em>.
Joe Spork opens the door. The man departs. Joe turns to Polly to say something about how they’re obviously not going to Portsmouth, and finds an oyster knife balanced on his cheek, just under his eye.  “Can we be very clear,” Polly Cradle murmurs, “that I am not your booby sidekick or your Bond girl? That I am an independent supervillain in my own right?”  Joe swallows. “Yes, we can,” he says carefully.  “There will therefore be no more ‘Say hello, Polly’?”  “There will not.
....though modern Marriage is a tremendous laboratory, its members are often utterly without preparation for the partnership function. How much agony and remorse and failure could have been avoided if there had been at least some rudimentary learning before they entered the partnership....And that statement is equally valid for all relationships.
Attitude determines Altitude. Winners never quit. No venture, No gain.
Marriage is just an elaborate game that allows two selfish people to periodically feel that they're not.
That's where your definition of attachment comes in. I'm in a monogamous relationship with two people.
Marriage is more about snore strips and flannel nightgowns than candlelight dinners.
Pa never told stories like Grandpa. Or treated the barn like family. Eli knew how Grandpa’s own pa had built the barn by hand, hauling bluestone for the foundation behind a stubborn ox with horns as wide as a tractor. How the smell of the plank walls was like family and how you never washed your chore coat so the animals would smell that you were family, too.
I wondered straightaway how he could sit at peace there, of an evening, with the row of heads staring down at him. There were no pictures, no flowers: only the heads of chamois. The concession to melody was the radiogram and the stack of records of classical music.  Foolishly, I had asked, "Why only chamois?"  He answered at once, "They fear Man."  This might have led to an argument about animals in general, domestic, wild, and those which adapt themselves to the whims and vagaries of the human race; but instead he changed the subject abruptly, put on a Sibelius record, and presently made love to me, intently but without emotion. I was surprised but pleased. I thought, "We are suited to one another. There will be no demands. Each of us will be self-contained and not beholden to the other."  All this came true, but something was amiss. There was a flaw - not only the nonappearance of children, but a division of the spirit. The communion of flesh which brought us together was in reality a chasm, and I despised the bridge we made. Perhaps he did as well. I had been endeavouring for ten years to build for my self a ledge of safety. ("The Chamois")
Really to believe in human nature while striving to know the thousand forces that warp it from its ideal development-to call for and expect much from men and women, and not to be disappointed  and embittered if they fall short- to try to do good with people rather than to them- this is my religion on its human side. And if God exists, I think that he must be in the warm sun, in the kindly actions of the people we know and read of, in the beautiful things of art and nature, and in the closeness of friendships.
...Next thing I know you've run off to Paris and thrown yourself under the nearest Frenchman-
And then I met the most wonderful boy in the world. We would take long walks by the river. We spent hours gazing into each others eyes. We were so very much in love. And then one day, he went away. And I thought I'd die, but I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself... is that all there is to love?
The self is constituted within a variety of arenas and in relation to multiple traditions. Self-hood, on this understanding, is both provisional and open-ended, and critically depends on the configuration of relationships between one’s own groups and those cultures and values that are deemed ‘other’. The regulation of alterity becomes a defining attribute of self-hood, as my sense of who I am is crucially mediated by an understanding of that which I am not (paraphrasing William Connolly).
flagrant, adj. I would be standing right there, and you would walk out of the bathroom without putting the cap back on the toothpaste.
Watching him with one eye, she wondered if men ever figured out that they were more appealing when they were pursuing their own work than when they were pursuing a woman.
Bad luck with women is a determined man's road to success. For every affliction, he makes, out of indignation, yet another advancement in order to exceed the man that the woman chose over him. This goes to show that great men are made great because they once learned how to fight the feeling of rejection.
This does not escape my notice, it is a context. I resent the fact of a context; my social status has shifted and no one is going to acknowldege it, that´s certain. I´m expected to be Brave and Rise Above. I dress for the role; I must look far better now that I did when I was married. I must look pulled together into a nice tight Hermès knot of self-containment. I don´t make the rules; I just do my best to follow them.
There is that, and there is also the Irreconcilable Differences line. It seems so catchall, so vague. You could say that about anyone, any man and woman at all. Jesus and Mary Magdalene: "Irreconcilable Differences." JFK and Jackie, anyone at all. It´s built into the man-woman thing. What kind of paltry reason is that? "Insanity" is another box to be checked on the divorce petition, the only alternative to "Irreconcilable Differences." I would like to check it.
To keep myself from harming or calling N and to stave off the rage and despair, I focus on my extraordinary son, drink midrange Chardonnay every night after he is asleep, and make a barrage of late-night mail-order retail purchases placed from the couch. The couch has officially become my second battle station. I am angry and I have credit And I´m all blackened inside; I should wear a pointy witch hat around Larkspur as I go to the bank and drop A off at day care. It would be more honest.
Clara shrugged and immediately knew her betrayal of Peter. In one easy movement she'd distanced herself from his bad behavior, even thought she herself was responsible for it. Just before everyone had arrived, she'd told Peter about her adventure with Gamache. Animated and excited she'd gabbled on about her box and the woods and the exhilarating climb up the ladder to the blind. But her wall of words hid from her a growing quietude. She failed to notice his silence, his distance, until it was too late and he'd retreated all the way to his icy island. She hated that place. From it he stood and stared, judged, and lobbed shards of sarcasm.  'You and your hero solve Jane's death?'  'I thought you'd be pleased,' she half lied. She actually hadn't thought at all, and if she had, she probably could have predicted his reaction. But since he was comfortably on his Inuk island, she'd retreat to hers, equipped with righteous indignation and warmed by moral certitude. She threw great logs of 'I'm right, you're an unfeeling bastard' onto the fire and felt secure and comforted.
When I opened my case in the hotel, he gestured excitedly at my snakeskin sandals, turquoise suede wedges and silver-speckled jellies. “But you’ve loads of shoes,” he bellowed joyfully. I shook my head sadly. Men just don’t get it, do they? They’re definitely missing the shoe chromosome.
A society which sees her modesty or her "hang-ups" as a problem is necessarily a society which will not be able to get him to commit. Conversely, a society which respected modesty, or what now goes by "hang-ups", was one in which men were obligated.
I know I am planning to visit a "land" that is not entirely foreign, only foreign to me. As an adventurer, I am on a journey that I believe will last me my whole life. A new relationship, discovery, or awareness excites me.
In an era of mass media, it is easy to believe that the more eyeballs, the more impact. But radio, television, and tracts accounted for a combined total of less than one-half of 1% of the Busters who are born again.
Back at home, days later, feel cranky and tired. Sit on the couch and tell him he's stupid. That you bet he doesn't know who Coriolanus is. That since you moved in you've noticed he rarely reads. He will give you a hurt, hungry-to-learn look, with his James Cagney eyes. He will try to kiss you. Turn your head. Feel suffocated. (from "How")
Pablo's many stories and reminiscences about Olga and Marie-Thérese and Dora Maar, as well as their continuing presence just offstage in our own life together, gradually made me realize that he had a kind of Bluebeard complex that made him want to cut off the heads of all women he had collected in his private museum. But he didn't cut the heads entirely off. He preferred to have life go on and to have all those women who had shared his life at one moment or another still letting out little peeps and cries of joy or pain and making a few gestures like disjointed dolls, just to prove there was some life left in them, that it hung by a thread, and that he held the other end of the thread. From time to time they would provide a humorous or dramatic or sometimes tragic side to things, and that was all grist to his mill.
Cyphel knew exactly how he felt about her as well — it was there in her expression whenever they spoke that beguiling combination of amusement and haughtiness that she carried off so well. It was a look that expressed disdain at Campion’s guarded advances but also a kind of measured probationary respect as well. It was a look that said You dare to think that I will find you as interesting as you obviously find me Well perhaps in that very act of daring you become interesting to me if only fleetingly.
[M]an is not an island, he is more like a spaghetti junction.
If your blade were as sharp as your tongue, you'd have sliced my through years ago.
You know what really fries my Puerto rican pancakes?
Do you mind?” she asked. “Mind what?” “While you were looking in the mirror I couldn’t help myself and I began fantasizing about you. And I figured if I was going to continue to fantasize about you, the only polite thing to do was to ask your permission. So now I’m doing the polite thing again and asking, ‘do you mind?’” “No, Nina. I don’t mind at all.” Then she leaned down and kissed him.
Couples will no longer spend their nights in their houses dedicated to habitation and reception, the customary social reason for banalization. The chamber of love will be more remote from the center of the city: it will completely naturally re-create for the partners the notion of ex-centricity, in a place less open to the light, more hidden, in order to return to the atmosphere of the secret. The contrary move, the search for a center of thought, will proceed by the same technique.
Discover the fulfillment of intimate relationships with flesh-and-blood neighbors and teammates in concrete place and time, and we escape the pressure of mainstream media to channel intimacy only as virtual embrace.
The lamb baa-ed vigorously as Mary dragged it into the manicure room, and Zel winced. She really should insist Julie come work, She could use the help, plus it would mean extra mother-daughter time--and, Zel thought wryly, I won't have to find a spare tower in the suburbs. Closing the appointment book, Zel went to finish trimming Linda's hair. "Did I hear a sheep out there?" Linda asked. "Sick dog," Zel said. "Now, bend your head down." Linda obeyed and Zel ran her fingers through the back of her hair to check for evenness. All she needed to do was think of a way to make Julie come without Julie immediately assuming her mother was trying to ruin her life. Not an easy task.
Moreover, in conversations with women, men do most of the talking (Haas,  1979), and despite hackneyed stereotypes about women being more talkative  than men, we're apparently used to this pattern. When people listen to record- ings of conversations, they think it's more disrespectful and assertive for a  woman to interrupt a m~ than vice versa (Lafrance, 1992).
He's a sweet man whose crime was that he didn't love me quite enough, and because this wasn't much of a crime I had to make up some bigger ones.
I admit I get the occasional headache," I said. "I admit some of my hangovers are epic. But usually all it takes for me to bounce back is a sauna, cold-plunge pool, steam bath, massage, and wasabi to clear the sinuses".
Miss Austen’s novels … seem to me vulgar in tone, sterile in artistic invention, imprisoned in the wretched conventions of English society, without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world. Never was life so pinched and narrow. The one problem in the mind of the writer … is marriageableness.
I'm not an ageist, and I'm not looking for a man in a certain restrictive age range, however I've found over the years that people younger than me tend to be immature. The problem with this is that, as I get older, all the good men have already been snapped up.
Gott weiß, wie schwer es mir fällt Beziehungen zu genießen. Ich verhalte mich immer wie ein Geheimdienstler, der seinen Partner als Doppelagent enttarnen will.
Beautiful building,” Phoebe said. Sam nodded. “Classical Revival,” he said. It was yet another display of his seemingly unending knowledge that both made her proud and made her feel very small. Maybe if she had gone to college she would have learned about building styles and understand what Classical Revival meant. They could have intelligent discussions about things like rooflines and columns.
He tries to force the anger down, but it's like an anvil on his chest. He closes his eyes, like Sammy taught him, and forces the anvil up; he softens.
This is what we had become, after the first symbiotic year of our living together: a couple who needed another couple to be around.
Medea kills her brother. In the beginning, she is known by her nephew, who tells the Argonauts about her, for having power, for helping her family, just like I tried to help Skeet on the day China first got sick from the Ivomec. But for Medea, love makes help turn wrong.
I’ve stopped letting somebody else’s mood adjust my day. No matter how much I care for this person, I will create a distance that’s well deserved. My days belong to me.
When she lets it, Trish's voice puts a fullness in you that is beautiful and awful, makes you feel like a glass of something waiting to be spilled.
We were ruined, permanently, and this was one of many signs to come, a message meant for me especially, glowing neon gas that said: LET HER GO.
Sometimes how we learn to love ourselves is by loving others and seeking to answer the question "How may I serve?" rather than "What's in it for me?" So, don't wait 'til you've learnt how to do that before entering into your next relationship, because it is in the context of relationship that we learn how to love and how to let love in, not sitting on the sidelines trying to work it out.
I’m big on how you move. How you treat others. How you treat me. How you treat yourself. While words are special — they don’t mean too much to me without the movement.
But it’s not always plain sailing, even when you’ve found the right girl. You’ve got to be in it for the long haul. You never know what’s going to happen: you sign up for whatever comes along. There’s no backing out.
Love the women in your life. Let them bloom!
I find it fascinating that in all our exploring of the world's nooks and crannies, my three kids most loved the times we settled down and stayed somewhere awhile.
The name has always occupied a space between the concrete and the abstract, the individual and the social, but when it begins to be shaped and charged with meaning in places removed from the physical world, in that way entertaining the world of fiction, albeit unseen by the majority, at the same time as this fictional world is expanding and taking up an ever greater part of our lives - the TV screens are now not only in our own rooms, but also on the walls of our trains and under the luggage bins of our planes, in the waiting rooms of our doctors' offices and the halls of our banks, even in the supermarkets, quite apart from our carrying them around in the form of laptop computers and cell phones, in such a way that we inhabit two realities, one abstract and image-based, in which all kinds of people and places present themselves before us with nothing in common but being somewhere other than where we are, and one concrete, physical, which is the one we move around in and are more palpably a part of - when we arrive at a point where everything is either fiction or seen as fiction, the job of the novelist can no longer be to write more fiction.
One can never call me a quitter  I take something right and see it  through till it’s wrong Auctioning myself off to the lowest bidder Going once, going twice Gone Sold to the man for the price of disdain Some are sold for a song I don’t rate a refrain I guess it was all going just a little too well If I wasn’t careful I’d be happy pretty soon Heaven’s no place for one who thrives on hell,  One who prefers the bit to the silver spoon.  Then just when I’d almost resigned myself to winning When it seemed my bright future would never dim When my luck looked as though it was only beginning I met him.  Sullen and scornful; a real Marlboro man The type who pours out the beer and eats the can A tall guy with a cultivated leer One you can count on to diaprove or disappear I knew right away that he was a find Given this, he was the kindest man I’d ever met Back came my sense of worthlessness And my long lost pangs of regret I was my old self again, lost and confused Reunited with that old feeling Of being misunderstood and misused.   Sold to the man for the price of disdain All of this would be interesting  If it weren’t so mundane
Amare non equivale ad essere innamorati. Innamorarsi significa pensare di non poter più fare a meno di una persona. Amare è averne l'assoluta convinzione.
They keep texting you wyd and wya — instead of how you feeling — what’s on your mind — and you wonder why you feel misunderstood
Each of us must make it our priority and personal responsibility to stay in harmony with our fellowman. Harmony is not just about creating a pleasant environment; it produces synergy. The best way to explain synergy is to say that a hand is much more effective than five fingers working independently. I tested this theory one day using dumbbells. I wanted to determine the maximum number of pounds each of my fingers could lift independently. Two pounds was the limit. I then tested my capability with my fingers working together. I rationalized that five fingers times two pounds each should yield a maximum of ten pounds. Not so. I lifted thirty-five pounds!
All she wants in a relationship is "L O Y A L T Y" that word is too big for a heartless man.
Women use sex to get love. Men use love to get sex.
Law of Attraction 101 — the basics. Don’t waste someone’s time if you don’t want them wasting yours.
We just drifted apart . . . I began to find his company <i>extremely tiring</i>."  "It was extremely tiring, but we were all addicted to it.
We’ve all heard that women tolerate sex to get relationships, while men tolerate relationships to get sex. That is simply not true—but there is something truly chilling about the fact that most Americans believe it’s true and use this formula as a guide for behavior.
Your best friends are in trouble and you say 'of course' and forget them instantly.
I must stay with you, stay near you, do your will, or die.
Don’t ride with someone until the wheels fall off. — It’s called maintenance. —
Maybe there are some people you can’t unlove no matter how hard you try. Maybe there are some people you stay connected to, because they’ve hurt you to your very core. You keep hoping that somehow the pain can be resolved if they finally do the right thing, but the right thing can never be done because it had to have been done in the past.
You will always be my first love. My first everything. No love will be like the one I had for you, but I think the loves that come afterward can be just as good and most of the time better, because we are better. I was jealous when you first started dating her, because I could tell she was different. I kept wondering what she had that I didn’t, but it wasn’t her that was different, it was you.
Maybe we love people forever. Maybe some relationships were derailed by time and circumstance, but somewhere in the background there was a place where that love still existed, where you were still those two people in that time.
I hurt myself by hurting you.” His face wore a look of compassion. I hated that look, because it reminded me that he was a good person, that he had tried over and over to apologize. He unwittingly brought out the part of me that I hated, and I projected that hate onto him, because it was easier to hate someone else than to hate myself. Tears poured out of my eyes. And he wrapped his arms around me, holding me as wept.   And I hated that his arms still felt good.
Relationships don't break you; they reveal you.
I wanted to keep him there to hold me up, to rely on, to remind me that there were places we found in other people that were safer than any walls could keep us.
I shall not attempt here to describe my marriage. Some impression of it will doubtless emerge. For the present story, its general nature rather than its detail is important. It was not a success. At first I saw her as a life-bringer. Then I saw her as a death-bringer. Some women are like that. There is a sort of energy which seems to reveal the world: then one day you find you are being devoured. Fellow victims will know what I mean. Possibly I am a natural bachelor.
The Romantic vision of marriage stresses the importance of finding the “right” person, which is taken to mean someone in sympathy with the raft of our interests and values. There is no such person over the long term. We are too varied and peculiar. There cannot be lasting congruence. The partner truly best suited to us is not the one who miraculously happens to share every taste but the one who can negotiate differences in taste with intelligence and good grace.   Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate dissimilarity that is the true marker of the “right” person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it shouldn’t be its precondition.
Choosing a person to marry is hence just a matter of deciding exactly what kind of suffering we want to endure rather than of assuming we have found a way to skirt the rules of emotional existence. We will all by definition end up with that stock character of our nightmares, “the wrong person.”   This needn’t be a disaster, however. Enlightened romantic pessimism simply assumes that one person can’t be everything to another. We should look for ways to accommodate ourselves as gently and as kindly as we can to the awkward realities of living alongside another fallen creature. There can only ever be a “good enough” marriage.   For this realization to sink in, it helps to have had a few lovers before settling down, not in order to have had a chance to locate “the right person,” but in order to have had an ample opportunity to discover at first hand, and in many different contexts, the truth that there isn’t any such a person; that everyone really is a bit wrong when considered from close up.
I want to be cut off from people like Marloe. Being a real person oneself is a matter of setting up limits and drawing lines and saying no. I don't want to be a nebulous bit of ectoplasm straying around in other people's lives. That sort of vague sympathy with everybody precludes any real understanding of anybody . . . And it precludes any real loyalty to anybody.
...from "greenhorns" you get what you want, from "veterans" you get what you deserve
Love strengthens soul connection and is the key to the success of all meaningful relationships.
Your wife can't give you that. All she can do is fool you into believing you don't want the things you actually want. That ain't grace," Wiggins said. "That's trickery.
A marriage is a very secret place.
Some people may either love you or hate you. But you should never convince anyone to love you!
I'm trying to work out if people need to start out at one hundred percent or if they can start at, I don't know, seventy, and work their way up.
Common danger made common friends.
Most friendships are a sort of frozen and undeveloping semi-hostility.
I am sorry that our friendship, or whatever name one may give to the obsessive relationship which has bound us together for so many years, should end in this way. This is not the place to utter its elegy.
The virgins are certain there's a circle of hell dedicated to that fear you'll never find anyone else.
Embodied devotion and dedication is about how we give ourselves to the world; it’s about our relationships with other embodied beings.
Studies have shown a woman looking for a 'sense of humour' wants a man who makes jokes and who likes to laugh. A man looking for the same quality in a woman does not expect her to be funny; rather, he wants her to laugh at his jokes.
Maybe the concept of friendship is already too colonized by liberalism and capitalism. Under neoliberalism, friendship is a banal affair of private preferences: we hang out, we share hobbies, we make small talk. We become friends with those who are already like us, and we keep each other comfortable rather than becoming different and more capable together. The algorithms of Facebook and other social networks guide us towards the refinement of our profiles, reducing friendship to the click of a button. This neoliberal friend is the alternative to hetero- and homonormative coupling: "just friends" implies a much weaker and insignificant bond than a lover could ever be. Under neoliberal friendship, we don't have each other's backs, and our lives aren't tangled up together. But these insipid tendencies do not mean that friendships are pointless, only that friendship is a terrain of struggle. Empire works to usher its subjects into flimsy relationships where nothing is at stake and to infuse intimacy with violence and domination.
love alone isn't enough to make the relationship work.
For women, right from the day they went to their first party, always hoped too much: how many dances, seemingly successful, had been grim failures covered over with a smile; how many invitations accepted became invitations regretted; how many plans and dreams had become stupidities; how much pretence that all was well, when it wasn't? We are too personal, she thought, in the way we interpret a look, a tone of voice, a smile. How lucky to be a man and never pay attention to the little things; how fortunate to take people as they are, and not to suffer from taking them as you would like them to be. How terrible to be a woman, to feel the difference between the dream and the reality, and yet to keep dreaming in spite of reality.
If you are in a toxic environment, you will waste away.
She was quiet beside him, lost inside another world. One of those things that people called books. She sipped her tea with one hand and held her book in the other that was propped on top of her lap. Every now and again, he’d watch her, like he was doing now. He didn’t mean to intrude on her universe but he liked seeing her in her element. He wondered what sort of effect this book in particular would have on her when she finished it. Because every book rendered a different response. Would she cry? Smile? Let out a gasp for fresh air? Assume the fetal position? Throw the book? Have a look of indifference? Before he had met Eleana, he’d always thought that books had been harmless. Because what could words on a piece of paper really do to someone? But he knew better now, especially on those rare occasions where he himself would pick up a book and read it. Books were dangerous little things and while they seemed harmless, they were anything but. They were so much more than ink and paper. Reading a book was like meeting someone new for the first time. Sometimes you hit it off and became the best of friends. Sometimes they wrecked you in all the wrong ways. Sometimes in all the right ways. Sometimes they left you hollow. Sometimes they left you floating on a cloud. It was difficult to find that one book that completed you just as finding that one person was.
She is the nymph who keeps enticing me the sailor evey time!
When in a relationship, short or long term, one becomes so used to doing things, even mundane activities, with the other person. Then the relationship ends, and it's like trying to play the piano with an amputated finger. You can do it, but it doesn't feel right for quite a long time.
Come to every conversation with three prepared stories to tell. Sometimes others do not want to talk, and by having some talking points in mind, you will always have the conversation flowing.
Before we feel You were always dressed In black and grey; I came with my colors And you changed; Is this love?
Scents were always about what was growing and what was dying. What would last through the next season. This was just with people instead of trees or flowers or dirt. Maybe I could read them after all. The thought gave me hope.
There is no meaning to life unless there is commitment and love.
In relationships being a great woman is a man's gift.
Even though we remain the same person, we have different types of relationships with our parents, children, spouse, relatives, friends, teachers, students, colleagues and neighbours. Each type of relationship fulfils a need which other relationships can’t fulfil. A happy person is one who maintains all types of relationships in life.
Remember that family is not just feeling that people have towards each other but a series of duties and responsibilities that must be fulfilled.
If you cannot handle The darkest pieces of her Don't ever dare to say That you love her!
In every lifetime you are at the center of someone's universe.
It is amazing when two people can mean so much to each other. When the happiness of the other person means your own happiness. And the sadness of the other person means your own sadness.
If you are not his first thought in the morning, he does not deserve a place in your dreams...
Silver and gold pale into insignificance if you flatter me with blue nights, romance me with pink lips and woo me with purple prose...
When the inevitable meets the unstoppable, that is where souls turn to lust...
Neither time nor distance should matter. Anything is doable...For love...
A relationship will devalue when one puts a price on it..
So, you charmed her into your bed and you think that is enough? No Sir, your big dilemma is, what are you willing to do to keep her there?
I am roses and thorns and pearls from the deep...
Our souls stretched across time, spanning the universe in search of each other and suddenly, there it was...life, love, desire, all we had to do was indulge...
Travelling to new worlds, experiencing strange sights, sounds and tasting the unknown becomes ever more delightful when shared...
I hope that our paths would never diverge  And that we don't get lost As we keep walking   In my silence I sing the songs of your love  I shine  From the moment I met you
He says nothing yet  How do I understand everything   Why does my soul vent out the anger  At someone my heart adores   Why do his words go straight  To my heart and  Deep into the soul   Why does the time fail  In telling the truth
My heart  That is unaware of dreams  Whispers your name From all the corners
Maybe the dream is just life's way of getting us out of bed in the morning and in reality, we are all just chasing stardust...
There are so many different attitudes, like different lives, in a face and in a body. So many lines and forms, so many strengths and weaknesses. The expression of health, of nervousness, even the expression of truth, are things you can look at. How long it takes to know them all. And you never do, not completely. A body or face is never the same even in a single day. And the mind, that's even more difficult.
One day, someone will say “I love you” and you will hear “family”. That is a love worth surrendering to.
I get asked this question the most: “What’s your number-one tip for improving someone’s sex life?” My answer is always “Communication.
There is no destination in marriage. It is the journey that matters.
Relying on one person can make you dull so broaden your outlook, find new friends and have new experiences...Life is waiting for you to live...
This classic speaks to us not by asking for replication of everything it depicts, but by inspiring us towards emulation of the timeless principles it demonstrates. By coming to know its characters from this principle-centered perspective, we can come to know ourselves better.
I condemn you. Yet my heart yearns towards you. I would go with you through the fires of death. Yet am happiest alone.
A very important lesson I've learnt through life: 'There is always a time to move on.' People are sent our way for a reason. When their role is over they have to leave, because they are required at another place for another reason. Their exit from our lives may not be smooth, it may even be hurtful or uncomfortable - but when you see signs that life is pulling you apart, let them go. Hold on to the good memories, but let them go. Allow that space for someone else who might need YOU for a reason. Let them go, as someone else might need them. It's not necessary to make it dramatic or tragic, because nothing is permanent in life; nothing is promised. Just be thankful that they were there when you needed them the most.
Why believe in dreams, that promise a reality, which will never be?
More than friends, eh? More than friends... You know, my mother once told me that half of the hatred that springs up between people is rooted in this mistaken belief that there's any human relationship more sacred than friendship.
Women don't want to be seduced. They want to be seen and listened to. You can't do either of those things if you're thinking up strategies on how to win her over.
Doing and saying the right thing are not sufficient. Doing the right thing IN THE RIGHT WAY and with the person's comfort in mind is critical.
When you get to create something that you enjoy and get to share it with others to enjoy also that is the best thing, sí? That is, in a way, respect and love and relationship. That is saying I want you to also have what is the best; I want the best for both of us, for all of us, sí?
She had an understanding, beyond language and beneath words, free of culture and upbringing, a universal something, received and recognized by an internal barometer.
Everything I do is a love letter addressed to you.
I love you deeply and in the future, I may love you more however, that does not occasionally preclude me from plotting your death by shooting you, chopping you up and feeding you to the wolves...
Ten seconds is the distance between silence and a smile...
There is a secret about human love that is commonly overlooked: Receiving it is much more scary and threatening than giving it. How many times in your life have you been unable to let in someone’s love or even pushed it away? Much as we proclaim the wish to be truly loved, we are often afraid of that, and so find it difficult to open to love or let it all the way in.
The person you love has all kinds of seeds in her: joy, suffering, and anger. If you water her anger, then in just five minutes you can bring the anger out in her. If you know how to water the seeds of her compassion, joy, and understanding, then these seeds will blossom. If you recognize the good seeds in her, you are watering her self-confidence and she will become the source of her own happiness as well as yours.
Messed around and fell in love with myself unconditionally.
We are aware that blaming and arguing can never help us and only create a wider gap between us; that only understanding, trust, and love can help us change and grow
When we look deeply and honestly at our own suffering, energies, and views, we find a peace that comes from being comfortable in our own bodies. But our true home is not only inside us. Once we have become comfortable in ourselves, then we can begin listening deeply to the suffering of our loved ones, and begin understanding their experiences and views. Then we can become a true home for each other.
Darling, I know there is a seed of anger in you. I know that every time I water that seed, you suffer and you make me suffer too. So I make a vow to refrain from watering the seed of anger in you. I also promise not to water the seed of anger in me. Can you make the same commitment? In our daily lives, let’s not read, view, or consume anything that waters the seeds of anger and violence in us. You know that the seed of anger in me is quite big enough. Every time you do or say something that waters it, I suffer and I make you suffer. So let’s not water these seeds in each other.
It does not take more than one thoughtless phrase to hurt someone.
We’re all searching for a place where we feel safe and comfortable, a home where we can be truly ourselves. As we become more skilled in mindfulness and lay down the roots of fidelity, we can truly relax with our partner. All the restlessness and searching inside dissipates when we find our true home.
She's such a lovely woman, he'd tell me time and time again. I'd nod, because my mom is such a lovely woman. And charming and smart. Can't argue with any of that. She's also a fucking wack job.
Daddy said, "At some point you will come to accept your limitations."  "Do you accept yours?" I asked, with challenge in my voice.  "But of course, Ladybug. That's what marriage teaches you.
Maybe that's what it means to be in love, to willingly be at the mercy of another person.
She inspires me... Loving her has been a life-changer. She made me a better man... a man you can trust... a man you aren’t afraid to love.
If they ever let me in those pearly gates, I'm going to walk all over God's heaven until I find that girl. And the first thing I'm going to do is ask her if she would marry me, and do it all over again.
After a while, you unlearn how to merely survive. You learn to live. To thrive. To breathe. To appreciate the finer “things” in life. All the while realizing you can’t take any of the things with you. Only the energy. The spirit of it all.  — You never forget those “things”.
When they show you who they are — you know what to do already.
To having a real relationship, is one skill that we must master. Is to appreciate who u are, an be grateful for the time u both sacrifices!
We must listen to love before we reason for love is the reason. The reason of being, the purpose of life, it is love, simply love. Anything else stands at risk of getting lost in translation.
If you must lose, then lose with style...
I do not need to compete for attention, I merely require competent attention...
Your spot on someone's schedule speaks volumes...
If you can only desire her by repeatedly risking all, then you neither love, desire nor value your woman, you merely desire control...
When life hands me lemons, they had better be pink ones!
Even with a lot of goodwill, we can still make the other person very unhappy. Mindfulness is the paintbrush in the art of happiness. When we are mindful, we are more artful and happiness blooms
He may be a nobody to you, but he is a somebody to me..
Your partner needs your attention and your watering of his or her positive seeds. Without that attention, your relationship will wither.
He was an erotic necessity, clad in denim...
The covert conversation between fingers and flesh feverishly heightens the senses and emboldens the soul when the prospect of discovery is inevitable...
I can't believe you called me," Anna said. "Nobody else from home has called me in forever. It's like they forgot about me. You think you're so close to people but when it comes down to it, they just <i>forget</i>.
Anna, are you asleep?"   He imagined Anna lying awake, eyes wide, staring at the ceiling, her heart full of yearning, but there was only silence.  "I love you, Anna," he whispered, and he hung up the phone.
On the other hand, she happily kept him informed about plans she had with other people, providing a steady flow of information about excursions that were about to happen, details of dates or parties that were always <i>this</i> close to coming together. As long as he listened, without complaint, to an endless description of activities that were supposed to happen without him, there was a 30 percent chance, at least, that Anna would change her mind at the last minute, claim to be unable to handle the unbearable burden of whatever her social plans were supposed to be, and decide to hang out with him instead. She'd arrive at his house and collapse in exaggerated relief: "I am so <i>glad</i> we're doing this, I was <i>so</i> not in the mood for another party at Maria's." As though they were both equally at the mercy of circumstance, similarly oblivious to the power dynamic that governed their "friendship.
It's really easy to be patient and sympathetic with someone when it's theoretical, or only for a little while. It's a lot harder to deal with someone's craziness when it's constant. . . .
Did he even exist in her mind, as a living, breathing, thinking person? He spent so much time trying to figure out what she was thinking, but what kind of a consciousness did she imagine lived behind the mask of his face?
For the first time, Ted imagined fucking Anna the way he (almost) fucked Rachel: cruelly, without concern for her comfort, fully acknowledging that as much as he loved her, he hated her, too.
She puts her head on his shoulder, and for a second, it's like the other good night, the night of the bonfire, the brief lifting of the yoke, freedom from the circle: Marco hurting Anna, Anna hurting Ted, Ted hurting Rachel, these endless rounds of jealousy and harm.
What is wrong with me, that even <i>this fucking loser</i> won't give me what I want?
Push too far into independence and we disconnect and hurt each other. Then in a longing for togetherness, we seek each other out; fumbling around for the warmth of the other. Push too far into intimacy and we get afraid of losing ourselves in it and head the other way. It is the ongoing interplay between independence and intimacy.
Who would willingly walk the path of love if they knew its cost without first being seduced by its promise?
She doesn't know what to call it—this free-falling sensation she feels every time she looks at Taylor, like her hands are closing again and again on emptiness—but she thinks she knows better than to call it love.
It was as if they had never been apart.
It takes quantity as well as quality to develop warm and caring relationships.
You can't make the other fellow feel important in your presence if you secretly feel that he is a nobody.
The best way to help people is to see the best in them.  The 101% principle: Look for the 1 thing I admire in them and give them 100% encouragement for it.
After a point, all marriages become boring, some are peacefully boring and some are annoyingly boring.
Sexual intimacy shouldn’t occur before there is communion, understanding, and sharing on the emotional and spiritual level.
You have to learn how to be comfortable with yourself and focus on making your own home within. Once you have a spiritual path, you have a home. Once you can deal with your emotions and handle the difficulties of your daily life, then you have something to offer to another person. The other person has to do the same thing. Both people have to heal on their own so they feel at ease in themselves; then they can become a home for each other. Otherwise, all that we share in physical intimacy is our loneliness and suffering.
When we can see our partner as not separate from us, not better or worse or even equal to ourselves, then we have the wisdom of nondiscrimination. We see the happiness of others as our happiness, their suffering as our suffering.
First, we just acknowledge that it is there inside us. If we don’t listen to our own suffering, we won’t understand it, and we won’t have compassion for ourselves. Compassion is the element that helps heal us. Only when we have compassion for ourselves, can we truly listen to another person.
If your love is true love, it will benefit not only humans, but also animals, plants, and minerals. When you love one person, it’s an opportunity for you to love everyone, all beings. Then you are going in a good direction, and that is true love. But if you love someone and you get caught up in suffering and attachment, then you get cut off from others. That’s not true love.
If you and your partner both have a deep aspiration, then not only will you support each other’s happiness, you will bring more happiness to the world in ways that you, by yourself, cannot.
With great understanding, we see the way out of our bondage. We discover the lightness and compassion necessary to love someone else
True love gives us a lot of space. Because you are connected spiritually and emotionally as well as physically, you do not need to always be in the same place or doing the same thing. You do not worry if your beloved is over here today and you are over there.
When restless sexual desire arises, we pay attention to it with enough understanding and enough love that it dissipates and does not grow.
Beauty and goodness are there in each of us. A true spiritual partner is one who encourages you to look deep inside yourself for the beauty and love you’ve been seeking. A true teacher is someone who helps you discover the teacher in yourself.
We can look around and see that a person who lives with happiness and compassion has the capacity to make others happy.
With our faith in our community of two or more, we can go anywhere.When the three roots of faith, practice, and community support have fed us deeply, then we will be solid both alone and in our relationships. We will not just survive; we will flourish. Often in our daily lives, we are just focused on survival. But fidelity is not a question of survival. It is one of vitality.
If you have a difficult relationship, and you want to make peace with the other person, you have to go home to yourself. Go home to your garden and cultivate the flowers of peace, compassion, understanding, and joy. Only after that can you come to your partner and be patient and compassionate. When we commit to another person, we make a promise to grow together, sharing the fruit and progress of practice. It is our responsibility to take care of each other. Every time the other person does something in the direction of change and growth, we should show our appreciation.
New love is brightest, and long love is greatest; but revived love is the tenderest thing known upon earth.
He'd never empathized with Rachel more than he did in those moments, imagining what it would be like to be innocently eating lunch with a person who had been acting for all the world as though he liked you, who had given you no hint that anything was bothering him at all, when suddenly, out of nowhere, <i>wham</i>, it turned out you were completely wrong about him, and that everything he'd been telling you was a lie.
Between himself and her there was that kind of division which is more insurmountable than enmity; for estrangements produced by good judgment will last when those of feeling break down in smiles. Not the lovers who part in passion, but the lovers who part in friendship, are those who most frequently part forever.
Men are like horoscopes,” Trixie cut Skye off. “They always tell you what to do and are usually wrong.
When you’re in your twenties and you haven’t fully realized what you look for in a partner, the single market has about everything you can imagine and more. And you’re like a blank canvas—everyone’s like a blank canvas—as you discover how to paint a relationship together.   Later in life, when you’ve experienced love and heartbreak and you find yourself single again and returning to the spouseless market, you kind of figure out that what’s left for you…is not a blank canvas for you to write your story on anymore. Every bachelor comes with a previous story, with drama and emotional baggage from their past relationships.   And you—you—have to deal with it all, measure the puzzle pieces and see if somehow they might fit within the gaps and cracks left by your own experiences.
<i>Why do you like me? Why can't you tell I'm not that into you?</i>
We don't have to stay in a repeating bad story, We can pick up a new book which is better and happier, just by putting the other book down.
Relationships are a gift from God. One cannot arrange what is not written in Heaven. Both people must feel the spark of God which ignites the love and says, “Come this way, I have a good story for you.
We make people special to us, believing that they can save us. When one thing doesn’t work, we look somewhere else to be saved. We rarely question the concept, itself. Sometimes, we don’t look to another person to save us but to money, acknowledgement, a title, a cause, a notion of ourselves. None of it can save us. We travel the path in different ways; some are polite, some are ruthless, some are clever, some are instinctive. In the end, it all leads to the same despairing place. In the unsuspecting quiet moments, there it is; a sense of peace and a feeling that everything is fine without searching for anything to be saved by.
It is not for you to decide who you will love and trust. Love those who come into your life. Love them for as long as they wish to be there. And then still love them even if they are no longer there. You cannot run out of love or give too much away. You don’t have to decide or arrange anything. Your happiness is already assured.
Lies rob us of our trust and we project our untrustworthiness onto everyone around us. Have you ever noticed that the innocent are very trusting? They neither lie nor hold other people’s lies against them. Liars, on the other hand, see sabotage everywhere.
Never win at the expense of the relationship.
Do not be afraid of love or the course it will take. There is no certainty in life. Choose love first and choose love last and it will give you more than you ever give it.
It was the moments; the precious moments. The moments when no one was complaining, blaming, thinking about past hurts or the fear of future ones. It was those moments of simply being present to another person. Those moments of being grateful. Gratitude for another being; gratitude for life. Those moments made their relationship.
The relationship, whatever form it may take now and in the future, is already in motion. It is already bringing up the right issues. Regardless of its destined outcome, it is working in that good/bad, pleasure/painful way that important relationships do. Keep your own eyes on a straight course of love and trust and it will help to move everything in that direction.
It was so easy in high school when all it took was the same taste in music and cool trainers. We just took it from there, easily, naturally, like a stroll.  Now, we are reduced to comparing profiles, seeing if somewhere in the mix of our emotional dramas and their emotional dramas, our preferences and their preferences, our plans and their plans, we can find a common path to walk together at a similar pace.
ON MY WAY, I was learning, was the product of Barack's eternal optimism, an indication of his eagerness to be home that did nothing to signify when he would actually arrive. ALMOST HOME was not a geo-locator but rather a state of mind.
You can't support long-term relationships, there are times when people are no longer interested in me.
Every so often, over the next day or so, she would find herself in a gray, daydreamy mood, missing something, and she'd realize that it was Robert she missed, not the real Robert but the Robert she'd imagined on the other end of all those text messages during break.
The week wasn’t even over and on top of Sam and Emma getting dumped slash divorced, Zoey remembered Ben the janitor freshly divorcing his spouse and Christopher Grave breaking it off for the billionth time with none other than Anthony Bush, her first adult crush. Those two were probably going to go on and off like the Grand Slam anyway.   The world was soon coming to a broken-hearted zombie apocalypse with the not-so-better halves roaming the Earth in search of the one meant to put an end to the misery, sales of self-help books going high, therapists’ agendas fully booked, and chick flicks gone out of the shelves of video rental stores—if there were any left post Netflix.
El secreto de la felicidad, o, por lo menos, de la tranquilidad, es saber separar el sexo del amor. Y, si es posible, eliminar el amor romántico de tu vida, que es el que hace sufrir. Así se vive más tranquilo y se goza más.
He unrequitedly loved Anna; Anna unrequitedly loved Marco; Marco probably unrequitedly loved some rando none of them had ever met. The world was pitiless. Nobody had any power over anyone else.
Whenever he was bored or anxious, his brain distracted itself by worrying at the question of whether he could ever make Anna like him, like a dog working the last bits of marrow from a bone.
Given how little contact Ted had now with actual Anna, it was like he was in a relationship with an imaginary friend.
Ted was wildly uncomfortable. He wasn't quite sure who Rachel was on a date with, but it didn't seem to be him. He'd contributed nothing to the outing; as far as he could tell, she could have brought an inflatable doll with her to the movie and had an equally good time.
Still, she really did seem to be absurdly into this. It was almost existentially unsettling, that two people in such close physical proximity could be experiencing the same moment so differently.
Oh, my <i>God</i>, Ted," she moaned, fakely.  They dated for the next four months.
The most important relationship throughout your entire life is the one within; cherish it.
And yet sometimes he'd lie awake at night imagining Rachel telling her story to a tribunal of all the girls who'd ever rejected him, regaling them about his deceptions, the way he'd pretended to like her when he didn't, the mask of 'niceness' he wore when the truth was he was a selfish, lying piece of shit—and he saw all those girls, Anna at their center, shocked but not shocked, nodding and agreeing that yes, of course, they'd known something was wrong with him all along.
What is a woman? Her brothers' sister, her father's daughter, Her husband's wife, her children's mother
It's a complicated relationship, being a good grandparent, because it hinges on a series of other relationships... Because being a grandparent is determined by the relationship your child has with you, partly determined by the one a son or daughter has with his or her spouse, partly determined by the relationship you have with the person your child has chosen to have a child with.
You like the gentleman, then?" said Muna. "I don't dislike him," said Henrietta unpromisingly. [...] "I don't dislike cabbage," Muna found herself saying, "but I should not consider marrying it. <i>Not</i> disliking seems a poor foundation for future happiness.
Eye contact beats any conversation.
You've got to find a man who will build you up. Enough with the boys who like to break things apart and put them back together just to see how they work. Even though you have already built yourself up, the value in adding anyone else to your life lies in the question if whether or not they can add more to that structure. If not, you're better off alone. You've got this one life, who are you going to let into it? And why?
Being a sugar baby was like being a groupie, but for any guy who was rich.
Since so much of our identity is constructed through our social relationships, which rely so heavily on language, aphasia can obliterate that feeling of belonging
Take good care of relationships. God has never come down from heaven to do anything on earth by Himself. God works through men! God uses people to pour out blessings in your life. The person you despise today can be your saviour tomorrow. The answers to your prayers are locked in people. You cannot be praying for promotion at work yet trashing your Boss. You cannot be praying for success in life/business yet manipulating, using people, lying, cheating people every chance you get. Some relationships that could've blossom and brought more open doors, business referrals or better opportunities in future are killed prematurely because of quick/immediate gain. Destiny helpers don't come with white clothes and wings.
Death, distance, and time, shall each one of them dig graves for your affections; but this you do not know, nor can know, until the story of your life is ended.
Do not get married if you are not ready to be faithful.
Someone once told me a story about long-term relationships. To think of them as a continent to explore. I could spend a lifetime backpacking through Africa, and I would still never know all there is to know about that continent. To stay the course, to stay intentional, to stay curious and connected – that’s the heart of it. But it’s so easy to lose track of the trail, to get tired, to want to give up, or to want a new adventure. It can be so easy to lose sight of the goodness and mystery within the person sitting right in front of you.
Love is the reason so we must listen to love before we reason.  - on the origin and purpose of life.
I should warn you in advance that I want you to know me and why I became a sugar baby. Most people aren’t comfortable with the idea of older men dating younger girls and exchanging money, so it’s important to me that you get why I did what I did. And I want you to understand that the difference between being a sugar baby versus being a prostitute is the connection. Although sometimes “sugar dating” is just a code for escorting, those people are just not doing it right. To really sugar date correctly, you have to feel something for the man who takes care of you, and he has to feel something for you. And you won’t feel anything for either of us if I don’t tell you all the good and bad parts of the story. And believe me, there are a lot of good things and a lot of bad things to this story.
One gets away with a lot when one is in an unchallenging relationship or is too busy to invest in one at all. Mostly, one gets away from oneself.
The idea of dating anyone for money wasn't considered respectable, even though that was something practiced since the beginning of time.
A man who wants a woman who’s uncomplicated doesn’t truly want love, because he doesn’t truly want a woman. Because all women are complicated. Girls are complicated. The only things not complicated are transactions, and that’s what Matthew and I had.   And with our arrangement, I realized, he wasn’t paying for sex. He was paying for me to be uncomplicated, and I accepted the money to hide who I really was.
Relationships that help us change negative characteristics are relationships worth building and maintaining for life, because the other person is looking out for our best interests and wants us to progress spiritually.
Circumstances, luck, mutual need, affection and time played a part. No relationships were made in heaven. They were made because living things were looking for good company. And when you found good company, you valued it deeply and were responsible for its up-keep and well-being.
She loved Harry and so, when he disappeared, when he withdrew into vagueness and alcohol, she had despised him passionately.
Women are looking for a man that currently does not exist and men are looking for a woman that no longer exist.
Relationships sometimes break like a falling vase into fifty pieces. And when you glue the vase back together, you realize it has lost the luster and pristine appearance that will never return. Now you have two choices. Keep it as it is or throw it away. – 1984
Writing poems is the best revenge.
We washed her body, chanted, and stayed to witness the funeral director shrouding her and whisking her down the hall. I thought of the Zen teaching that talks about how all we need to do is allow ourselves and the world to change. Easy to say, I thought. And yet, here I was in the midst of my experience of fullness of the pain, grief, love, and joy of my grandma’s death. Everything did change.  Everything I teach now I learned from my relationship with Mimi. Being deeply in relationship changes the world. I didn’t know then that my life would pivot to teaching others and to being with many, many Mimis.
As your walk with Christ grows, your relationship with your spouse grows.
YOU can master relationships only if YOU are able to differentiate between who is “praying” for YOU and who is “playing” with YOU.
Watching you  stare into space in the tidy rows of the vegetable garden, ostensibly working hard while actually doing the worst job possible, I think  you are a small irritating purple thing and I would like to see you walk off the face of the earth because you are all that's wrong with my life and I need you and I claim you.
The belief that the people around us will reciprocate in proportion to what we give them is called "trust.
Polite, socially acceptable suppression of our rage is "inauthentic," insofar as we are not sharing our full selves. And that is part of trust, too. Part of being trustworthy is meeting expectations and staying in line, as if you were a well-behaved woman.
What I lack in the looks department, I make up for in the everything else department.
All these 29 year-old women should be married by now. I would marry all of them. Hmm that doesn't sound quite right.
Be wise and break the silent treatment before it break down your relationship beyond repair. Pride repels love ask the devil he will tell you.
The constant vigilance and my heightened anxiety that I'd screw it up anyway exhausted me, but I persevered.
The problem isn’t that they don't show you love, respect, and attention... The problem is that you wish they would... and now you’re begging, hoping, and giving endless second chances. They don’t value you and if you don’t change something, they’ll convince you to not value yourself. Stop arguing with reality. When it comes to love, respect, and attention, the right person won’t have to be begged.
It’s not that love lacks power. Rather, it’s that we’re too frightened to submit to a power that will demand vulnerability when we’ve invested the whole of our lives building walls.
To love pleasure takes little. To love truly takes a hero who can manage his own fear.
To look for solace is to learn to ask fiercer and more exquisitely pointed questions, questions that reshape our identities and our bodies and our relation to others.
I think when we love people we offer them the opportunity to break the barriers that prevent them from finding the love they deserve.
You will never be lost in your lives if you rely on the love you have embraced and the love which embraced you.
Everything I have described so far seems to have happened to somebody else—to somebody else’s father. But the death of a parent happens to you, and, once it starts, it never stops. It dislodges everything.
We were a religious sect consisting of two people, and now half the congregation was gone. There would be no closure, no healing. I would simply adjust myself to a new and severely depleted reality. The world would come to an end, as it always does, one world at a time.
Relationships develop best in the absence of a previously stated goal and a strict timetable, but relationship management means setting goals and creating a plan.
Time and shared experiences are key ingredients to creating bonds that last.
You really love him, huh? Not just the sweet ‘oh, we met in high school and just couldn’t seem to find someone else’ sort of love, but the epic, desperate, ‘move mountains and cross oceans’ sort of love.” I chuckled. “I think that would be an apt description. When you realize that someone would do anything for you, even if it means separating themselves from you, risking that you’ll never love them again, just to make sure you’re safe and well . . . There’s no coming back from that. You’ll do whatever it takes to be with them. You might want to kick their ass a few times along the way. But when you find that, you don’t let it go.” Jamie shuddered. “Too mushy?” I asked. “I’ll survive.
You know, Raymond, when you're at a party, at a dance. And it's maybe a slow dance, and you're with the person you really want to be with, and the rest of the room's supposed to vanish. But somehow it doesn't. It just doesn't. You know there's no one half as nice as the guy in your arms. And yet.... well, there are all these people everywhere else in the room. They don't leave you alone. They keep shouting and waving and doing daft things just to attract your attention. "Oi! How can you be satisfied with that?1 You can do much better! Look over here!" It's like they're shouting things like that all the time. And so it gets hopeless, you just can't dance quietly with your guy. Do you know what I mean, Raymond?
In long-standing relationships, sometimes, it's not that the other person become marginal, rather you tend to consider your partner a part of yourself and, as for your arm, even if you never say how important it is to you, it would be terrible if it wasn't there.
I’m awfully interested in how big things begin. You know how it is; you’re twenty-one or twenty-two and you make some decisions. . . then whissh! you’re seventy. You’ve been a lawyer for fifty years and that white-haired lady by your side has eaten over 50,000 meals with you. How do such things begin?
You are me and I am you. I don't feel you are separate from me!
Repay kindnesses and generosity bestowed upon you by continuing the giving. Extend yourself freely to others to sustain the positive cycle of giving.
If it is love we are making, even though we are apprehensive or frightened, we are willing to untangle the bones of the Death nature. We are willing to see how it all goes together. We are willing to touch the not-beautiful in another, and in ourselves.
Even if you are just starting out in your career, you have valuable perspectives and advice to share.
When they weren't on the beach or sailing, Alicia and Jack were indoors, usually in the basement watching movies. Alicia missed so many important films during those frightening years.
When you find a partner and the joy of this relationship inspires you to make improvements in yourself. Hang on, and let it grow. If your partner is feeling the same way, this is wonderful appreciation for each other. It’s heartwarming. Your best complements will come when you’re both together.
She looked at him with clear disgust and said You realize of course you are rife with multiple addictions. He replied- Well perhaps But I like to think of myself well rounded in that regard and BTW I’d appreciate if you would lay off my hobbies.
The relationships you genuinely care about are the ones that will form the strongest network you can build.
Any activity such as dancing which involves frequent, long-term interaction with another person creates a great deal of mental, emotional, and physical memory in our being.
Both the challenge and the spice of relationships is in people's differences. Occasional frustration is the price of admission.
She gives me meals that stick to my ribs. She don't forget to put salt in the porridge. She never slams doors, and when she has nothing to say, she don't talk. That's uncanny in a woman, you know, Mister.
The man who lets himself be dominated will never have consistency in his relationships.
If you want to know how easy it is to love someone without holding back, forgive that person genuinely and try loving that person again. You will experience love in 3D and in high definition.
If you do not have a forgiving heart, stay far away from love otherwise you will spoil the beauty of love.
Love is not enough, you also need hope and faith for your marriage to stand firm.
Do not think of yourself as a crescent moon, waiting for someone else to fill in the missing part of you. When you stand alone like a full moon, already complete in yourself, you will meet another person who is whole and complete just like you, and between you two, a healthy relationship can grow. Do not try and fit yourselves to each other to make one whole moon. Instead, be more like two full moons. You’ll respect each other’s individuality and interests while creating a relationship in which each of you shines brightly on the other
People will reveal who they are if you just pay attention.
The daily life of lovers often begins to share resemblances, so that, in time, each day becomes indistinguishable from the one that came before it. The lovers carry each other's words in their hearts when apart and when together; they laugh; they talk; they make love; they argue; they eat; they tend to poultry together; they watch television and dream about a future together. This way, time slips and memories accrue until their union becomes the sum of all the words they have said to each other, their laughter, their love-making, their arguments, their eating, their work with the poultry, and all the things they have done together. When that are not with each other, night becomes to them an undesirable thing. They despair at the masking of the sun and wait eagerly for the night, this cosmic sheet that has separated them from their beloved, to pass in fervent haste.
Our moods meet in the wrong places.
I would. When we do we won’t know where it starts and where it ends. Sex for us would be a spice in our soup pot of love mixed with other ingredients to make our lives’ meals exciting. A spice alone can’t cook you a soup. You need dozens of ingredients to make it work. People burn their love pots for failure to combine the basic ingredients.
Couples need the salt of understanding themselves … the palm oil of care so they could blend. They need appropriate seasoning of trust to avoid unnecessary friction in their midst. There has to be unhindered flow of water of communication. They must deeply love themselves so as to unite and make each home a sweet pot of soup.
If I’m going right and she’s going left, then she’s not the one for me. If she’s straining to change me and I’m too rigid in my ways, you can see clearly conflict is brewing. If I’m making a joke and she doesn’t have enough sense of humour to catch it, then our house is on fire and that girl can’t be the one for me.
Sex is often had by someone to whom it means everything with someone to whom it means nothing.
You can't be with someone when there are secrets. Relationships like that don't survive, they sink.
In his 1964 talk on feminism, Winnicott says something he's been saying all along. "...We find that the trouble is not so much that everyone was inside and then born, but that at the very beginning everyone was <i>dependent</i> on a woman." Winnicott sees this dependence as the root of misogyny--though he never uses that word. Perhaps, like Woolf with "feminism," he felt plain language was more persuasive. "The awkward fact remains, for men and women, that each was once dependent on a woman, and somehow a hatred of this has to be turned into a kind of gratitude if full maturity of the personality is to be reached.
Creativity is alive And thriving in my body. The energy you bring out in me Is within me infinitely. My power is overflowing. My lips are soft and welcoming To the exhale, The new Braille, The silence that persists After our moans die away, I look at myself and say,  "Root down so you can burn. Beautiful girl, it's your turn To create magic within yourself. This time, without his help. Find your roots and find your fire, Be mindful of what you desire, Persist in what you know is true, Stay focused on the endless route Toward your own potential. Allow the existential Void to swallow you whole. Take on your old role: The lone seeker. Become quieter. Become meeker. Become the beauty that you seek. Embody strength if you feel weak. Find love within the walls Of this sacred temple. Let yourself shake and tremble, But keep your eyes ever fixed  On the horizon  Where it's rising, No revising, Fears capsizing As you sail, sail, sail Toward the wail Of your siren spirit Beckoning you to bloom The flower in your womb, The seed of creativity, Your triumphant legacy." These words, I will carry Within me as I bury Grains of wisdom  In the whispers of the wind. And when I arrive  To the altar of our origin, I'll be dressed in white and black, And I'll cradle that exact Feeling left on our sheets. And you'll be on your knees, Ready to receive The wholeness of my broken mind, Pried open by The sparkle gleaming in your eyes. And your hands will be full Of supple fruit and you'll  Smile at me, and I will see That you have fed your hunger. You'll ooze with courage and wonder.  And then, we will know  That we've already lost each other  A thousand times before. And I have found you As clear water after mud settles. And you have found me As a bee deep in a flower's petals. We have danced before, Pulled art out of each other's spines. We have died and birthed and died. We've already kissed a million times. This wasn't our first five act play, And it will not be the last. So when I thirst for your hands, I will sit and chant. We will meet again. We will meet again.
The irony of lost love is that a person discovers wisps of wisdom when addressing their bundle of pain and frayed emotions. Relationships that fan out in flames contain learning rubrics in the dying embers.
Some relationships are like french fries. They look good, taste good but they are bad for your health &amp; heart.
He picked up the pieces, keeping his favorite parts away from my hammer.
People confuse love with sex. Having sex doesn’t mean you’re in love. Sex with the wrong partner destroys. Wrong mating is the major cause of the devastation the world is witnessing. If only true love could reign in the hearts of couples, then the entire world would witness peace. Harmony in the homes would create cohesion in the communities and cohesion in the communities spells agreement amongst nations and that would readily translate to global peace. But tension-filled homes which are the products of loveless relationships are infecting the bloodstream of international relationship and that’s the number one reason for chaos everywhere. The chap with a gun shooting down others I can tell you is a child from a loveless home. He knows no love and can’t extend it either. The world has plenty of sex but is wanting in love.
If you were often rejected or ignored by your parents while growing up, you can end up seeking the love and attention you were denied from your romantic partner instead. If your partner is even slightly indifferent towards you, then the wound from your childhood can be ripped open, causeing a big fight with your partner. But the real cause isn’t your partner; it’s the wound you are carrying around within you. Rather than projecting this wound onto your partner and causing a fight, set aside your pride and speak from the heart: “I am terrified that you will reject me and leave me, like my mum/dad did.” If we combine painful memories, the need for attention, and pride, the relationship can easily be ruined.
When the right person hugs you, it's like medicine. I'm so grateful for those few people in my life who are good for my soul.
For some, even those who have immersed themselves in the life of the church - and certainly for me - no relationship seems to satisfy this yawning hunger to be known, to be loved, to be inside some nameless space that remains frustratingly, confusingly closed
The computer agntold scale. It also paved the way for increasing reclusive conduct at work and at home. It is becoming increasingly difficult for us to foster lasting professional relationships when the world clips along at megabyte speed and coworkers occupy a private office or separate cubicle. Prior forms of face-to-face communication are rapidly becoming obsolete. The computer age allows people to participate in a vast network of electronic communication and our escalating dependence upon electronic communications will foster rapid e opened doors to mass communication at depersonalization in the workplace. Some people will be frozen out of regular social interactions and no longer enjoy an uplifting one-on-one working relationship that people instinctively crave.
One of the most boring things about being in a relationship is that your partner usually makes their boredom your problem.
Trust is a present deposit of a future assurance.
See the passion kiss the lips. Don't let this person slip by. They've given you a lustful heart. An emotional gift.
You have to love her more when she does not have time to love herself!
She will not tell you all her thoughts, feelings, and emotions. You have to understand her unsaid words.
Why does my heart refuse to accept that it can't be near you all the time?
Love is not a feeling, but the characteristic of a productive relationship. Failing to understand this is our great error in a time when all of us are chasing love as a goal, but finding only an extraordinary lack of love, for which we then blame ourselves. Our misunderstanding of love continues to make this situation worse. A world in which love exists in fantasies but has no actual potency loses the ability to facilitate fair negotiations, bestow meaning, or produce anything other than purely monetary wealth.
No matter how many times I go back and forth between dreaming and dreading it, love always calls me back home. Through tender love songs and cute love stories and quirky rom-coms (which I actually don’t watch too often), it always manages to renew my faith in its existence. I may not have it yet, but I believe it’s out there somewhere waiting to find me or be found.   That will always give me hope.
Minutes may pass into hours, and hours may pass into days, and days may pass into months and months may pass into years but my heart will keep on falling in love with you every moment!
Why does my heart desire you all the time?
Look at someone every day for long enough and you stop seeing what everyone else sees. You start to see what no one else sees, what is kept hidden from most people.
what matters is not who initiated but how we responded thereafter. We both responded with affirming words and validating actions. We invested in the relationship equally, together giving and receiving. We kept communication open the whole way through.
There is no one so cruel as those closest to you.
Birth of a baby not only creates a bond between a baby and its parents but it also gives birth to a small world called “Family.
Love is inconvenient. Love is untidy. Love is relentless, ruthless and rapacious. Done well, it’s hilarious, playful and redemptive.
One of the most puzzling aspects of love is its lack of justice. It’s unfair. Love can elude people who seem to deserve it while it’s heaped on those who appear to ignore it, run from it, or slough it off as too restrictive.
Maturity in any relationship makes the practice of love comfortable.
It's better to be with someone who has the same sleep patterns.
The law of giving: Give first.
(...) I also believe that most crabby people can change by making a conscious choice to react to the world in a different way. The key is to scan your environment regularly for things and people to appreciate rather than to criticize. In so doing, you create a new climate of praise and gratitude in your life. Instead of getting bogged down in people’s faults and mistakes, you get swept up in a fruitful search for reasons to say “thank you.

And this is the most provocative situation, is it not? It invites abuse, manipulation, tyranny, subjection. A person is supposed to accommodate herself--himself--absolutely to another person. It is unnatural. OK, but it's nature that sets it up in the first place. Of course, of course.  It is unnatural and provocative and precarious and challenging. It demands forbearance and stamina and abnormal powers of empathy and perception.  It is also... And yes, it is also all those other things. The opposite. The converse. The place you want to be.
She was such a solitary woman. A solitary woman who longed for one person to know her. I think I do know her now, but it is too late.
She was her own Enigma Code and me and my dad were not Bletchley Park.
The heart is not a small place, Many can reside there As long as the rooms are all decided.
With one touch of her hand, all my fears are hidden. It's almost like a vivid dream that can't go wrong
When you feel something isn’t right, you’re probably right. Listen to your gut instinct, it’s, sometimes, smarter than your heart.
Her face was an open book and yet he was still confounded by her.
Where his skin touched hers, it felt like there was a current of pure magic between them. It was enough to boil her veins.
Happy Valentine's Day  The very first day that I met you, your beauty exploded into my heart, like fireworks into the sky. And each and every day since has been like that very first day.
After truly knowing Ryke, I can't fathom shutting the door on a sibling. It's a bind that's different than a friendship. It's one that hurts more if it breaks, but when it's whole, it means everything
You also have to work with the love you are given, with all of the complications clanging behind it like tin cans to a bridal sedan.
It’s always her that turns a bad day, into a great week by simply saying hello
If my husband is working for Rose, he should not come to Mary for salary at the end of the month.
While waiting for her to phone me at school I'd feel seconds bursting inside me and leaving clouds. That won't come again—it can't. I'll never have that with anyone else. I'll never even come close.
I wanted to ask her if she meant to spend the night here as well, but I didn't want her to say yes. It could be that she was in some kind of mood and just wanted a nap and my question might force her to adopt a stance. She does that, I've noticed; she lashes out when she thinks she's been given a cue.
And you like doing all this ana-lyzing?' 'I used to, but the thrill is gone. Been gone. It's okay, though. It's a living.' 'And you studied many years to learn to do this?' 'Yep. New York University. Bachelor's and master's.' I don't even want to mention my M.F.A. 'Right.' He sighs as if he's putting this all together and then he looks me in the eye and says, 'Well , it seems to me that if one goes to college for so many years you'd at least end up working in some field that you derive a great deal of pleasure from. Don't you think?' 'Of course I do, Winston, but sometimes your attitude changes, your needs and values change, as you get older, and what used to excite you doesn't anymore.' 'So do you have this same attitude toward people when your attitude changes?' 'What do you mean?' 'I mean when you get bored or someone wears out their welcome do you treat them like you would your job? Do you just kind of settle in or do you look for a new one?' Damn.
Spend all your time burning bridges and you’ll end up all wet when you have to swim to shore on the return.
Love is not the result of adequate sexual satisfaction, but sexual happiness—even the knowledge of the so-called sexual technique—is the result of love. If aside from everyday observation this thesis needed to be proved, such proof can be found in ample material of psychoanalytic data. The study of the most frequent sexual problems—frigidity in women, and the more or less severe forms of psychic impotence in men—show that the cause does not lie in a lack of knowledge of the right technique, but in the inhibitions which make it impossible to love. Fear of or hatred for the other sex are at the bottom of those difficulties, which prevent a person from giving himself completely, from acting spontaneously, from trusting the sexual partner in the immediacy and directness of physical closeness. If a sexually inhibited person can emerge from fear or hate, and hence become capable of loving, his or her sexual problems are solved. If not, no amount of knowledge about sexual techniques will help.
There’s a difference between extending grace, and receiving abuse.
If we were in a proper relationship and I did live with him and was officially committed to him, first thing I would have to do would be to leave.
how much I’d been thwarted into a carefully constructed nothingness by that man
The sooner we heal our traumas, the sooner we liberate ourselves from the people who hurt us. By hating them, we hold onto them. We cannot heal.
Men were not as disciplined or as smart as women, she though: men almost always took what they were offered, their appetites too crude and raw to put up much resistance. There were like children, gobbling down their candy all at once, with no thought about the consequences of their greed.
Behind every death lay a set of questions. To <i>move on</i> was to agree to not disturb these questions, to let them settle with the body under the earth. Yet some questions so thoroughly dismantled the terms of your own life, turning away was gravitationally impossible. So she would not be moving on. She would keep disturbing and disturbing. She imagined herself standing over a grave with a shovel and hacking away at the soil.
also found the situation unworkable. Not just unworkable – ridiculous. Not just ridiculous – perturbing.
The surface dynamics of a relationship are often times confusing. Therefore, it is useful to separate out structure and essence in a relationship to better understand the deeper truth. The essence of the relationship is the Pure Love that is present. It is internal and independent of conditions. The structure of the relationship is what the relationship looks like from the outside.
No one replaces anyone else. No one substitutes for another person. Every person is unique. Every relationship is unique. Every relationship’s purpose is unique. Life is fluid; it moves. It doesn’t die; it reforms. Each day is new. We can only try and do our best for today. It’s enough, don’t you think? No more is asked. But also no less.
Women deformed by the pornographic sexual template perceive other women as masturbatory objects.
When someone shares their distress or their inadequacies, the natural inclination is to comfort them. To mollify. When we do this we brush over their emotions, often because they make us uncomfortable. Most times, people don’t want a blanket. They want someone who is willing to stand outside and shiver with them in the cold.
I firmly believe that relationships don't end because new people come along to break them up; people come along to break them up because something else in the relationship is already off.
You see the separation of life as very arbitrary at this time.  You are not alone in this assumption.  You have far more connection than you are even vaguely aware of.  You will not lose the love that is yours.
Whenever you feel a spark of love or goodwill towards another person – male, female, young or old – feed it so that it will grow. It is not about finding the right person or people. People are not that right. Even if they start out right, we soon have a litany of complaints. The only answer is to be the right person ourselves. Then everything will have a tendency to work together in a good way. And when it does work, don’t then be waving contracts, written or invisible, in front of people. Love that controls is not love but a contract. It says, "You must love me in this way," not "I love you." You have your freedom and life has its own justice so you don’t need to jump into the driving seat before the other person has an opportunity to. Just love. Love freely and genuinely. Love openly and with courage. And forgive, forgive, forgive. People are a mass of problems. Stop remembering them all or there will be no room to create the beautiful moments you wish to cherish in your soul.
Then I had an exhilarating thought: I could design the kind of relationship I wanted! I could think up what I wanted, and if my commitment was strong enough, it would come into being. I quickly sketched out my desires on a piece of paper. I wanted someone who was honest and loving, someone for whom taking responsibility was no struggle. I wanted a woman who would be willing and able to join me in a relationship where both of us expressed our full creativity. I didn’t have any requirements as to size, shape, or age: All I was really interested in was the quality of our ongoing interactions. If there was honesty, if there was responsibility, if there was a mutual commitment to creativity and spiritual growth, I would be happy. I really wanted a spiritual partner for the journey, someone for whom relationship itself could be integral to our unfolding evolution.   It took me less than ten minutes to clarify what I wanted. Then I added a radical clause: If it was not in the cosmic plan for me to have this high-quality relationship, I would gladly be alone. I vowed never to settle for anything less than what I really wanted, (...). I figured I would be better off by myself than I would be replaying these old dramas for the next fifty years. I vowed this deep in my soul. It was a done deal.
There are people who help you and people who hurt you. You keep the former. You keep the former until they become the latter and hope that you never hurt the former.
The person who doesn't have patience for your imperfections, is usually sitting on a mountain of their own.
You're still the same people, underneath.
Surely our greatest and most long-lasting relationship is with ourselves.
The truth is, I don't know how to talk to Sam. When he first arrived here, I was too starstruck to relax around him, and as the summer went on, I censored myself more than I would like to admit, always trying to say the right thing to get him to notice me, avoiding anything that would make him shut down.
There were three sides to a marriage: public and private and who-fucking-knows, one lived and one performed and one a thundering mystery.
Looking back, she supposed that had been one miracle of their marriage--even if a person was on the brink of swallowing fingernails and the other was thinking deeply about a problem they could not share, there was still someone to hold you as you wept through the night.
We sometimes fall in love at last sight.
Sex has, through being photographed, become a thing to be observed, to be performed, rather than experienced so deeply that it is unnecessary even to open one’s eyes.
even though it was weird to talk on the telephone. Only eight times, seven, maybe six, ever had I done so.
Anne declared that if Sarah abandoned her, "I swear to you I would shut myself up and never see a creature.
People may say . . . that all is made up and well again, but such breaches between great people are seldom or never so.
So ended . . . a royal friendship which once could not be contained within the common bounds of love.
Take what people give you and let that be enough. Because people usually give all they're capable of giving, the way they're capable of giving it, and expecting more than that is just setting the relationship up to fail.
It was never about saying the words to her, it was about watching her react once I had said them
Help someone smile and laugh today.
People need to treat valuable relationships as precious, but if that attitude spills over to bad relationships, misfortune will follow. In a lot of cases, people’s good or bad fortune is decided by their relationships with others. Just as good fortune comes through gui-in, misfortune comes through bad relationships.
I firmly believe strangers are just friends I haven’t met yet.
Invest your time and money in connecting yourself and others.
If you want to shine like a precious gold, focus always on yourself, both inside and out.
You can always end an argument. It starts with shutting your mouth.
Just because you're in pain, it doesn't mean you have to drag everyone down to your level of hurt. No one can help if everyone around youis in pain.
One thing I was absolutely sure of was his love. Love made any problem solvable.
We got the message that day. We could be friends at home. But out in the world, we didn’t know each other.
Every time you decide not to compromise your honesty in any form of a relationship, you become a co-partner with the Universe in creating truthful meaning for any existence.
If I am hiring someone at a senior level, it's critically important they are decent people. So I always take them out for lunch -- not a long one but enough so they relax, we talk, we get to know one another. But what I always do is notice how they treat the waiting staff; you can tell a lot about a person about how they do that.
The only things you take to heaven with you are the relationships you build here on earth.
There would be a lot fewer broken hearts when a relationship fails if people would understand that there’s no reason to want someone who doesn’t want you. Never allow yourself to feel half empty when you deserve a relationship that will fill your heart with happiness.
The best friendships do not require that anyone keep the upper hand.
The real rich all live with the motto that ‘there is no free lunch’ and they know how to cultivate and invest in good relationships with gui-in.
Let’s do life together – it’s far better.
The reason people fall into bad relationships is that their expectations are too high. Just wanting to get things from other people blinds you. If, on the other hand, you have the attitude that ‘I’ll be the first to give’ or ‘I’ll give more than I get’, you can avoid bad relationships and enter good ones.
The belief that someone loves us, or should or can love us, as much as we love ourselves is one of the most common signs of intellectual immaturity.
If a friend of yours has actually been secretly or unconsciously wanted to walk away from the friendship for a while then it's best they do so. You only want to keep relationships in your life that are thriving, that they are genuine. You don't want to maintain your grasp on a friendship where one person is fundamentally unhappy with it for one reason or another, or one person doesn't want to give the amount of energy and commitment that you do. Sometimes even if it hurts and it's shocking and we thought it would never happen, when a friendship ends it is actually, absolutely the right thing for us, because if they have had any doubt in their mind that the friendship wasn't right for them or beneficial for them, it's always best for us if they walk away. We don't want to continue to maintain friendships that allow them to linger, if there is something rotting that we never knew of. If we keep those kind of friendships in our life that are not built on a foundation of trust and mutual benefit, something is going to blow up in our faces.
Givers are never greedy. Greedy ones never give.
Your intentions matter, and they are felt by your clients, your prospects, and all of the people whom you interact. When you come from a place of caring, you generate trust and build powerful relationships. But if your actions are self-serving, they destroy trust and ruin relationships.
Maybe, you will kiss the modern bride Let's agree to disagree, babe on everything, in advance Just duct tape my heart to yours babe
It’s an amusing world, it’s easier to maintain distance than to maintain relationships.
Even relationship is hard work. You reap what you sow. And if one side stops then slowly and eventually it will all fade away. You need to be aware to make the other feel good such that in similar manner the other will make you feel good! This will keep the flame of relationship alive forever!
Why is it that I feel so alive when I keep talking or chatting with you?
Sometimes letting go is simply allowing yourself to come to terms with the truth that you have been watering dead plants.
The number of people we come close to during our lives is small, and we fail to realise how infinitely important each and every one of them is to us until we grow older and can see things from afar. When I was sixteen, I thought that life was without end, the number of people in it inexhaustible. This was by no means strange, since right from starting school at the age of seven I’d been surrounded by hundreds of children and adults; people were a renewable resource, found in abundance, but what I didn’t know, or rather had absolutely no conception of, was that every step I took was defining me, every person I encountered leaving their mark on me, and that the life I was living at that particular time, boundlessly arbitrary as it seemed, was in fact my life. That one day i would look back on my life and this would be what I looked back on. What then had been insignificant, as weightless as air, a series of events dissolving in exactly the same way as the darkness dissolved in the mornings, would twenty years on seem laden with destiny and fate.
Pauline believed that marriage was an interweaving of souls, while Michael viewed it as two people traveling side by side but separately. “What are you thinking about?” she liked to say, and “Tell me what you honestly feel.
The connections we create in our lives are the ones that will carry us through, even the darkest of days.
It's marvelous to know another person's entire literary canon by heart. It's like knowing their secret personal language.
Sometimes the beginnings of relationships are the hardest. People always say the beginning is the easiest, but two people trying to let their guards down and be open to intimacy can be hard too.
If it wasn't for you, there would be holes in my heart where stars used to be.
In big cities, in the summertime, people of long since lost track of each other or who don’t even know each other meet one evening on the terrace, and lose each other again. And none of it really matters.
I’m glad you told me. Thank you for trusting me with the truth.”  I looked up and smiled. “I trust you with my heart. Giving you the truth was easy.
I used to think that when a child was born, a parent made a promise to stay with him. Or her. But if there's a promise, it can be broken. That first Matthew Trewhella broke his promises. I wonder if he ever forgot them, or did the torn edges of his promises hurt him to the end of his life?  When someone goes away from you suddenly, without warning, that's what it's like. A rip, a torn edge inside you. I have a torn edge in me, and Dad has a torn edge in him. I'm not sure if those edges will still fit together by the time I find him.
God is not separate from us. The essence of God is in our hearts. Though we have veils between God and us on the physical level; on the level of the human body that does not mean God is separate from us.
Painful indeed is the panegyric of those we contemn.
You may search my countenance, but you cannot read it.
Sin is not about the personal imperfection of the self. Rather, sin is any act that breaks any of the relationships God declared very good in the beginning.
Tell the ones you love that you do love them before it is too late
But now he knew: you always sacrificed something. The question was what you sacrificed.
Everyone knows that sadness and grief are the price of admission for the experiences of joy and connection.
Givers are never greedy, The Greedy never give.
So we had the whole fight right then—because we had to, time running out and all. Because what if we didn’t have the whole glorious fight, and he went off to Santa Fe, and I regretted not being given this one dramatic scene that I was owed? I yelled and slammed drawers and flung myself around the room, but the whole time I knew in some kind of creepy way that I was acting out of some historical outrage rather than anything generated right there in the present catastrophe. If I had done what I really felt like doing, I would have been sitting in the corner sucking my thumb. Instead, I had to fight, I had to be madder than I felt. He sat on the side of the bed and tried to look guiltier than he felt.
It is in imposing my expectations on others that I birth my greatest frustrations.
If you didn't yearn for something, you wouldn't be disappointed- and anyway, relationships were a waste of time.
The art of working with people is found in meeting them where they’re at, which means I must be willing to go where I am not.
Hearts are broken if we are not prepared to heal ourselves
Recognizing that open relationships work for some doesn't threaten anyone else's relationship; it won't discourage anyone from choosing to be exclusive or from forming pair-bonds. We expect the majority will do just that and that dyadic and exclusive relationships will remain the predominant model. While we'd like to see people in those dyadic and exclusive relationships thinking their decisions through more carefully than they often do, we're not encouraging them to do anything that feels wrong. The simple answer to those who object to nonmonogamy is "Then be monogamous.
Designer relationships are based on egalitarianism and mutuality, not on proprietary thinking. From this perspective, if people decide they will have multiple partners, the approach is the antithesis of cheating. In the conventionally monogamous model, each party owns the other (a modern variation on the more antiquated view of woman as property). In designer relationships, each party voluntarily owes the other transparency, some measure of emotional loyalty, and a determination to abide by agreements.
The house was quieter than usual, the sounds muffled and soft. It made her throat ache: The darkness, the kitchen, the single light. It felt like she was watching a movie of her life from an earlier era. Before Mom left, before all the trouble. Guilt twinged in Madi’s stomach. Before I took off and left Dad to deal with Sarah alone.
Working briefly on your marriage every day will do more for your health and longevity than working out at a health club
I’m living life in color. I’m not compromising that.
He couldn't give me what I wanted, because he didn't have it to give. I saw an ideal of him and kept trying to get him to fit that mold because I didn't want to let go of the illusion of who he was.
Hope can have sharp edges as it leaves you.
There are so many people more concerned with how a relationship makes them look, rather than their own personal well-being. They hide the truth, many times behind a pretty white picket fence. Appearances are their very first priority, so they hang on to the relationship despite the abuse.
Seek to build relationships that are in alignment with your dreams. Relationships that'll challenge and inspire you to grow
I see the universe in your eyes
Who you meet is more important than where you go. Adventures are best remembered by the depth of connections with friends, not countries visited.
Don't let your life goals fall victim to the allure of comfortable routines.
You are the flame, not the moth. And your job is to burn with conviction.
Don’t underestimate your ability to bring value to someone else.
We have no obligation to endure or enable certain types of certain toxic relationships. The Christian ethic muddies these waters because we attach the concept of long-suffering to these damaging connections. We prioritize proximity over health, neglecting good boundaries and adopting a Savior role for which we are ill-equipped.  Who else we'll deal with her?, we say. Meanwhile, neither of you moves towards spiritual growth. She continues toxic patterns and you spiral in frustration, resentment and fatigue.  Come near, dear one, and listen. You are not responsible for the spiritual health of everyone around you. Nor must you weather the recalcitrant behavior of others. It is neither kind nor gracious to enable. We do no favors for an unhealthy friend by silently enduring forever. Watching someone create chaos without accountability is not noble. You won't answer for the destructive habits of an unsafe person. You have a limited amount of time and energy and must steward it well. There is a time to stay the course and a time to walk away.  There's a tipping point when the effort becomes useless, exhausting beyond measure. You can't pour antidote into poison forever and expect it to transform into something safe, something healthy. In some cases, poison is poison and the only sane response is to quit drinking it.  This requires honest self evaluation, wise counselors, the close leadership of the Holy Spirit, and a sober assessment of reality. Ask, is the juice worth the squeeze here. And, sometimes, it is. You might discover signs of possibility through the efforts, or there may be necessary work left and it's too soon to assess. But when an endless amount of blood, sweat and tears leaves a relationship unhealthy, when there is virtually no redemption, when red flags are frantically waved for too long, sometimes the healthiest response is to walk away.  When we are locked in a toxic relationship, spiritual pollution can murder everything tender and Christ-like in us. And a watching world doesn't always witness those private kill shots. Unhealthy relationships can destroy our hope, optimism, gentleness. We can lose our heart and lose our way while pouring endless energy into an abyss that has no bottom. There is a time to put redemption in the hands of God and walk away before destroying your spirit with futile diligence.
No longer married, suddenly I was <i>widowed</i>. From Latin, the name means "emptied." Far worse; it felt like being torn in half, ripped apart from the single functioning organism that had been our family, our lives. Shattered, the word kept recurring; the whole pattern shattered, just as the mountain rocks had shattered his body.
Who cares if the people in your life don't like the boundaries you set for yourself? Their happiness is not your responsibility
I felt his pain as my own and I wanted to touch him, feel him, reach inside his fractured heart and pull out all of the love he buried inside. I wanted to kiss every inch of his skin. I wanted to feel his brokenness against mine, like if we held each other hard enough something within each of us would finally heal.
As well as we know our grown children and relatives, we don't know how much energy they have to put into simply keeping their lives together at all.
I am,’ he whispers, 'the monster I warned you against.’ 'You are,’ I say hoarsely, 'the monster I claim.
A photon or an electron is not a thing, it is a description of a relationship.
Good relationships don't just happen. They take time, patience and two people getting through all the hard times together.
It was better to be alone than to be stuck with people who were supposed to love you, yet couldn’t.
It [realization of Oneness] means being constantly open to the possibility that we are like two flowers looking at each other from two different branches of the same tree, so that if we were to go deep enough inside to the trunk, we would realize that we are one. Just being open to this possibility will have a profound effect on your relationships and on your experience of the world.
I think sometimes we fall in love just because it feels so good to love someone, to desire them, to yearn for another human being, to cross the boundary of aloneness that is part of human existence.
We bother people with our problem whenever we tell them that we miss them.
You didn't lose me, Laurel. I'm still yours. I'll always be yours.' 'Well that's not strictly true, is it?' He sighs again.  'Where it counts. As the father of your children, as a friend, as someone who has shared a journey with you, and as someone who loves you and cares about you. I don't need to be married to you to be all those things. Those things are deeper than marriage. Those things are forever.
All I wanted was to merge with the same person who had broken me, thinking that he was the only one who could fill in all the little crevices making me feel whole again.
kick me. what else is left? I NEED RAW EMOTION and you got two good stories that are getting stale.
As I observed him sitting there, a heavy look in his eyes, I longed to reach behind that barrier and pull out the warm, sensitive, passionate man I knew was trapped inside.   There was nothing worse than feeling someone’s potential.
Kunyaza empowers women who frequently ejaculate, awakens hidden sensations of women who rarely ejaculate, and introduces a new possibility of sexual pleasure to women who did not know that they could ejaculate.
When it’s the wrong person, anything you ask is too much.
The search for security might translate into ways that you choose to guard your heart and emotions in romantic relationships.
There was a universe inside every human being every bit as big as the universe outside them. Books were the best way Nina knew - apart from, sometimes, music - to breach the barrier, to connect the internal universe with the external, the words acting merely as a conduit between the two worlds.
We can reach a place in life where a relationship would be nice, but our life style is already nice. If we mixed the two would they blend perfectly? We’re skeptical, that we’re reaching out to past failures? Having the strength and confidence to leave any relationship allows us to take a chance.
In the contorted bookkeeping of the broken, the distance you hold yourself away from them is your only value.
Your life and relationships are only as great as your sensuality.
Whoever taught you that love hurts, lied. It’s lack of true sensuality that hurts.
I used to think love was elusive. Until I realized I was just getting in my own way. I had to learn to let go and make room for someone to show me love... instead of holding on to someone I wish would.
Some people get lucky and partner up with someone the same age, they know the same songs, have the same references and all that, good for them! But for the rest of us it’s catch-as-catch-can.
Tain Shir walks the deck of RNS <i>Sulane</i> between the bombs and incendiaries and steel-tipped barbs. A weapon among weapons but she alone is free. The tragedy of the knife is the hilt. The tragedy of the crossbow is the trigger. Shir has neither. She cannot be gripped nor fired. She is unmastered. The sailors are rude with her. So be it. Etiquitte is the domain of those whose power is conditional upon the respect of others, and Shir is unconditional. If she drifted alone in the void beyond the moon or if she walked among the monarchs of the ancient Cheetah Palaces she would not be altered in her capabilities or her intentions, for not one truth of her resides within a relationship to any other thing.
When we live in alignment with who we are and how we want to live, we will attract and find like-minded individuals.
Love is vulnerable. Love is family. Love is Life. We hurt one another. We just do. But we also need one another. We all know hurt people hurt people. Wounded people lash out in anger and in fear. I like to call them porcupines. These are people who desperately want a hug, but if you dare hug them, you will probably be stabbed.
Our hearts are channels from which we experience and are connected to the divine flow of creation, it’s the channel in which we transcend our emotions and come to know love. In this space, we exist without constructs.
Love Request:   Isn't this all we request from love?  A brave, vulnerable and sincere exposure,  To be candidly seen in all our faults Blemishes, quirks and flaws  Yet still be so implicitly loved Cherished, accepted  And most of all,  Wanted
We read not only because we cannot know enough people, but because friendship is so vulnerable, so likely to diminish or disappear, overcome by space, time, imperfect sympathies and all the sorrows of familial and passional life.
Sometimes, it is necessary to distance ourselves emotionally in some relationships.
Resentment has a way of metastasizing into bitterness, and bitterness has a way of curdling into the kind of anger that can doom a relationship.
It’s quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see.
You have to believe me without proof. That's what faith is — believing without proof.'  They got up from the bank of stones. It was getting late, the shadows lay cool and lengthened on the grass and the tops of the trees had the stillness around them that means the end of the day and its liquidation in the setting sun. They retraced their steps back to the house where his car was parked, and when they passed through the blighted orchard, he picked up an apple for her and she ate it. She didn't even have to look; she knew it would be whole, without worms or decay.
People are more apt to remember how you made them feel than what you said.
If you want to make others feel good, start by feeling good yourself.
Hearts Don't Reject Love  Fear of rejection slaughters the voice from our heart But time is short And life is to be lived So don't fear to speak your hearts truth What you feel matters more than the thoughts or opinions of other's And rejection is an impeding, sinister state of mind...  Remember, hearts don't reject love, only minds do that The existential truth is that we are all exposed We are all vulnerable Whether we are fierce enough to admit it…or not
It is possible for you to be the wrong one in an argument about you.
Major turnoff… When someone’s sense of entitlement is greatly disproportionate to their sense of gratitude.
I have a loan of three yen from Kiyo, which I have not yet returned, although five years have passed. Do not think I cannot pay it back, but I will not, for the noble Kiyo will never dream of being paid back; she never lends me money in prospect of my greater income. On my part too, it would be a sin to think of returning it, as it would indicate that the tie binding us is based on duty and not upon affection. The more I think of such a thing, the greater pain would it give Kiyo, for it might mean that I doubted the purity of her mind. It is true the debt has not been paid back, but it is not because I considered it nothing, but because I think her a part of my own flesh and blood.
He who believes in soul mates never ceases to doubt if his current partner is, truly, “The One.” As a result, the great irony emerges: those who believe in soul mates are much less likely to actually find one.
The people you meet in your life, you meet them for a specific purpose: To help them and to be helped by them. So, try to spot the treasure in your everyday life, because one day you may realize you had the treasure and you lost it.
US, OVER TIME, PASSING BY  As time elapses we will grow older and we will grow wiser. We will fall in and out of love. We will destroy each other only to build each other back up again. We won’t even notice we’re changing until it’s already happened, because change is just the act of becoming. We see it happen so naturally every day. The sun sets, the night rolls in, the stars start to shine and the moon glows. When morning comes the dawn will creep in and embrace the night, allowing the day to break and the sun to rise again. We will continue to change, tethered to time and influenced by everything around us. The relationships we search for and the ones that search us out. The relationships we thought could never be and the ones that we could never live without. They’re all on their way to becoming something else, never static, always moving. Because time is the biggest player in the game, and it is why everything is changing. If you try to picture every moment in a relationship all at once, then that right there would be us, over time, passing by. Changing, folding, becoming something else.
They were all just sitting here. Waiting. What were they meant to be doing? The desire to interact was an irresistible itch.
Maybe [Snow White] never wakes up. More likely than anything else, really. You can’t kiss a girl into anything.
The signs you ignore in the beginning end up being the reasons you leave later.   —Trust yourself—
She is now dancing with someone else to the song that reminded me of us.
In my own relationships, I know that I should break up with someone who doesn't encourage me to be strong and make my own choices and do what's best in my life, so if you're dating someone who doesn't want you to be the best person you can be, you shouldn't be dating them.
If it didn't make you cry, it wasn't real.
Learning to eat, greet, learn and lead are indispensable for growth and impact.
A life-changing moment for me was the realization that sometimes the healthiest relationship you can have with someone (or something) is none at all.
Life is severe and coping is harder for some than others. We can make the journey trickier or easier, smoothing the path with grace or complicating it with more obstacles. This person is here to stay for the foreseeable future or forever, so he is a necessary member of your tribe. You can exercise compassion without enabling misconduct.
Maybe I'm too crazy to be in a relationship," Henry said, which was his familiar response to Bobby's familiar discourse about the future. It felt like a grown-up thing to say, and like a difficult concession, and what he meant by it was <i>I am trying as hard as I can and it's not enough for you</i> or even <i>Why can't my weak eccentricities be adorable to you, as yours are to me?</i> But Bobby always heard it as a conversation stopper, childish and easy and glib.
The other thing about falling in love: the harder you fell, the easier it was to get hurt. Maybe that’s why it was called falling in love; at some point there was a crash at the bottom that could shatter someone into a million pieces.
I’ve spent so long being afraid of love, because the last time I was in love, the man I loved only loved one part of me, but not all of me, and I thought love meant having to sacrifice a part of yourself. But then I was with you, and you loved every part of me, even the parts I don’t like. And that scared me more, because I thought there must be some trick and that I couldn’t let myself believe it or I’d fall into the trap. But finally I realized it wasn’t a trap.
I don‘t know if you noticed but I have been trying, too hard, to be myself since the day I lost you.
We ended the way all good things in my life had a way of being put to rest – abrupt and without my permission.
Realizing you wasted time with a boy who had no intention of growing with you feels much like selling yourself for a dime bag of weed
I'm so sorry no one cared enough to tell you that you can never win against a ghost.
There were many things she could have said, but we forget to forge armor against the knife-thrusts of our loved ones.
He wasn't the sort of person you interacted with and fluttered away from; he was the type of man you fell for. People got hurt when they got attached to other people, because people always left or were taken away. Falling in love, therefore, was just a set-up for inevitable failure.   She knew all this. But logic is fallacy when it spars with instinct. So she fell anyway.
Respect is love in action.
Dad?" she said.  "Do you want some coffee?" he asked. "Are you okay?"  She shook her head. No.  "There are only so many hours you can sleep in a stranded vehicle." He glanced at the dashboard of her car, then at the untouched receipt--her receipt--sticking out of the machine a few feet away like a white tongue. "There's only so many times you can try to resurrect the dead. You can sit there all you want but you're not going anywhere. And, stuck as you are, you'll be forced to think about it, forced to wake up at some point, forced to depart or die here.
They said let go, so I tried, knowing that I have never been able to let go of anything that was already attached to my brain. Like all the other moments where I was happy, I realised, all I wanted was more time. I wanted to be stuck, to stagnate, let me be the rock that drowns, let this be my future. I have seen uninhabited islands of anonymous colours as high as the clouds they lay on just to think of you, repeating itself like a parakeet or a perfectly broken loop traveling the world to find its and our spiritual oblivion. People only stay in your life depending on how much you persist with them.
- Love, which is a kind of permission to come closer than ordinary norms of good behavior might usually sanction. - Back rubs. - Which enables us to see each other without clothes on, for example, in lust and shame. - Examining perfections, imperfections. - Which allows us to say wounding things to each other which would not be kosher under the ordinary rules of civilized discourse.
It was if I made love to a nymph of the mountains or air or wind and she had come to me to make me fall in love and leave, with some grand plan behind those actions. The last time I saw her she was just looking anywhere but me, a magical siren who I was helpless to look at staring at her distant gaze. A side profile of one of the most beautiful things I would ever see, with her hair blowing through the fall Melbourne wind.
The biggest lie I ever told anyone was that I would not leave.
I looked outside your second floor living room window. I saw a view I had never thought I would see. There were trees of reddish brown hugging a river, dying but beautiful. Telling me I was so much more than a moment, and yet only a moment could define me at the present time. The future is unseen. Expecting to be better, is not always the truth. It takes something to smash your brains in, to squeeze your heart, to torture your soul in order to make you see what is in front of you
Close your eyes, what do you think about? Not all dreams happen with your eyes closed, but the ones that do are the ones that have the most imagery, the most hope. Hope can be a dreadful thing but it can be a beautiful thing. There have been many great philosophers who have said that hope and dreams have this false sense of themselves, that they are only fragments of the real or true. They may be right about being fragments, but that does not make them any less true. Dreams send us guiding towards ideas, that are true themselves, if only ideals, of goals that we should strive towards. It is cliche and commonplace to call dreams fantasies of the mind, wishful thinking of fading things. Yet there are things that philosophers cannot explain, that reason leaves, all philosophers believe themselves poets but leave the soul out of their writing. The mind and its reason, that is truth. That is the belief. Yet anyone who has looked at a view that has left them without breath has known of something more.
Love yourself enough to leave behind anything or anyone that no longer serves your best interest.
Two insane idiots with the same idea, that is what love is.
Most of the conversation was said with our eyes. Our eyes told truths neither of us could understand. Her a Goddess and me her pew. It was spent with me looking at her and her looking elsewhere. Perpendicular.
I think we could be good friends if you just saw me for the person I am, not the person you think I am. ~ The Goldfish Boy by Lisa Thompson
I lack experience. In so many ways.
People will tell you not to give up, but they're always tired of you.
When you enter your next relationship, you become the person you split up with.
Of course I will like forever any woman who has gone to bed with me, as long as we don’t become a couple and hate each other forever.
And us—we already changed—the two of us and both together—and now we gotta change some more.”  “Must we?” he asked, and she felt him put his cheek against her hair.  “I can’t see any way out of it, if we’re gonna do what we said we’d do. Right up front, we’re gonna hafta stop thinking that surviving ’til lunchtime is a long-term plan.”  He laughed, softly. “Until dinner, then?”  “It’s a start,” she said.
Heaven has never been a place, heaven is just a feeling...
I’ll listen to your words as long as your actions don’t speak louder.
Love is kind, not rude. Love brings heartbreak. Love brings life. Love brings healthy relationships. Love never forces .
Too many times we're stuck trying to revive the dead when we can't even rouse the living." The woman added a paperboard coffee sleeve around Lexi's cup. "I think if we spent as much time worrying about the life prior to the afterlife, we would likely have no time to contemplate the latter. Heaven and Hell are right here, inside of us. We take them with us wherever we go."  "That's pretty good." Lexi took a sip of the coffee, desperate for caffeine. "What are your views on relationships?"  Sahar smiled. "Don't settle until you find the one who makes you want to say ya'aburnee."  "What?"  "It's Arabic for 'you bury me.' The hope that the person you love will outlive you so that you will be spared the pain of living without them.
So many people bump into our lives for a second and it changes us forever, but they never know it. And while that's funny and strange and a little sad, it's also just life. And the truth of the matter is, it was never really about them anyway. It was always about us and what we were meant to learn from them. It was always about us and who we were meant to BECOME as a result of having encountered them.
I think men that read books are the most attractive kind.
Keep your memories, and I will keep mine. And maybe one day they will fit together like our hands once did.
I want to ruin you in the ugliest way imaginable so that someday, when you have to tell your children about me, it will take every breath you have to hide the catch in your throat
Don't fall in love with me. I am dissonance. I am always at war with myself – confusing my head with my heart, always retreating into my mind, because I don‘t want to lose.
When someone else's happiness becomes the prerequisite of your happiness, you know that you are in love.
Some silences are more meaningful than thousands of long sentences.
Take a break from relationships and dedicate yourself to self-care and personal healing. You need to stop bleeding on people who didn’t cut you.
He had started out as a snag, a snag in the composition; from one moment to the next, there was no other way of putting it, he had begun to appear in my life back in the city. And since all appearances are ultimately disturbances, this disturbance needed investigating.
Happiness can be found inside our own hearts and not in some shallow relationships. People with integrity know how precious time is and they refuse to waste it on people who don't bother to respect it!
We were lovers and enemies and the best of friends. At times, it was one more than the other. At times, we were all of them all at once. But there have been times, I admit, when we were two complete strangers struggling to live with each other. At times, we felt like We were just each other‘s habit.
You haven’t yet learned that your worth isn’t found in him. Or in the man before him. Or in any man at all.
Relationship problems are for rich people. Poor people have things like hunger, Bills, Clothes, and medicine..
Avoiding others because they don’t suit my way of life is tragic.
There will always be that one person we dream of, even if we do not sleep.
There are two kinds of relationships. One that gives you everything and another that takes everything away you have. The latter will do nothing for you except fooling you around, feeding you with petty lies and never give you a sense of security.. Now it depends, for how long you’re gonna be fooled and for what?  There’s no love, This is not love.
You know how it is when you arrive in a new place and feel like you don't belong there? That hesitation to recon with a new geography. That knowledge that this place is not mine, these ways of talking are not mine, these silences are not mine, this etiquette is not mine.So many new things to absorb. And the place also takes a little time to accept the new person. Often you have to meet the place on its own terms. Sometimes you have to work hard to earn your little corner in it. Till that place become yours, till you find your own equilibrium, there will be a gap between you and the place.
Il ciclo è molto più difficile da rompere di quanto la gente capisca.  Sento ancora che le donne adulte / i membri della famiglia consigliano alla nuova generazione come devono cucinare meglio, mantenere la loro casa pulita, ascoltare il loro uomo di più, avere meno opinioni, e per l'amore di tutte le cose, vestirsi come una donna, aggiungere più trucco e tenere sotto controllo il loro peso in modo che lui non vada via.  Eppure, per ironia della sorte, le stesse donne che erano oppresse o ristrette dalla loro cultura, e combattono disperatamente per il diritto all'uguaglianza sono quelle che impongono l'oppressione e la restrizione alle giovani generazioni.
Relationships take time, but we don’t want to take the time. In reality, too busy is a myth. People make time for the things that are really important to them.
The women I write about have to fight for what they want, sometimes against forceful odds It's a kinetic experience, an intense ride.
People prefer talking about each other rather than talking to each other.
Women who play hard to get make life seem shorter.
I color my nails black and dye my hair red to wear, in metaphors, what my heart wants. The things I don‘t wish to remember, leaking from the tips of my fingers. The things I wish I won‘t forget, clinging to the roots of my hair.
THE SPACE BETWEEN US Mind the space, so long endured, it’s best for our protection. I hope it’s true, for if it’s not a thousand loves have I betrayed.  Look closer, dear, a voice it sings as if it was a lullaby. But if I heed it may become the lure of my demise.  In fear, we come together seeking a place of refuge. In fear, we keep the space lest our refuge become our captor.  The moments of sweetness so easily discarded when danger calls from the abyss between the two.  Do not push away love’s hand in punishment for what it cannot give. Together we bypass the gap which is as deep as it is old.  Forget the chasm so jaded with angry dreams. Our fear is empty-handed. Love’s hand has room for the other.
Our outlines feel the same. I think I can hide inside you.
He was broken in the best way – in a way that made me stop and stare and want to love him.
It is never just a kiss. It is the marriage of two minds that have decided they can stand each other‘s arrogance.
You look like someone  who has gone to war  and came back  with a thousand deaths burned in his eyes.  You look like someone  who has been told a dozen promises –  promises that broke his heart when he realized he didn't matter enough  for them to be kept.  You look like someone  whose edges started to chip away.  You look like someone I could love,  someone whose darkness I could light up.  But goddamn it, darling,  I promised myself  I would never fall in love with a broken man. I have loved so many broken people  and I have fixed them all up.  I kept giving all I had,  until I had nothing left to give.  You look like someone I could love,  someone I want to fall in love with.  But you‘re in pieces,  I know you‘ll just wound me.
CAN YOU NOT REMEMBER? When did this brutality grow? Can you not remember? Go back to the place where you left that man dying. This time you must bring him back with you.  I see you in my dreams. Your face is edged with battle. I touch your forehead from a distant land. The Earth glare is so bright. It washes the white memory from your mind. Have you forgotten we come from the same place? Settle, settle, peace, peace.  When did this brutality grow? Can you not remember? Go back to the place where you left that man dying. This time you must bring him back with you.  You are looking for something, demanding to be found. Make your way back from that broken land. Return from that empty place. There is nothing there for you. It holds a million shadows. There are no friends there. Settle, settle, peace, peace.  When did this brutality grow? Can you not remember? Go back to the place where you left that man dying. This time you must bring him back with you.  It is warmer here. Can you see the light? Trust it. It is safe. It has lived a long time. It has seen much more than you. You fight a demon that you once knew but the demon is already slain. And from the corner of your eye you will see the scattered, sacred fire reform again. Settle, settle, peace, peace.
All those other gestures of sympathy seemed a little melodramatic to me. My loss was mine and only mine. For the others, it was just a matter of words.
In the end, the longest and most important relationship any of us will ever have is with ourselves. That’s why I believe self-awareness is so important. We all need to learn to become comfortable with ourselves as early as possible, and to grasp that we are responsible for who we are. And, as I said, the best way to get to know ourselves is through our relationships with others.
People like people who are like them.
Effective listening is the single most powerful thing you can do to build and maintain a climate of trust and collaboration. Strong listening skills are the foundation for all solid relationships.
This is the foundation of the law of listening: You have to listen to understand.
Listening is a powerful building block: Continue improving your listening skills and your likability will naturally increase.
Genuine curiosity can lead to more authentic, engaging conversations, which lay the foundation for sustained relationships.
But continuing to initiate conversations and be curious about people is fundamental to building valuable relationships, because curiosity creates connections—that is the law of curiosity.
I didn't see how much of my self-worth had been tied into that relationship until it was over. The hardest part wasn't leaving her behind; it was feeling like I'd left pieces of myself behind. The only pieces I liked.
Time moves quickly  In the blink of an eye  You're gone  Do you miss me  Feels like yesterday  We were on  Blissfully Grab your chin  With my palm  Kiss your cheek
Once in a blue moon life will blow you a rarity and it will leave you with astonishment.
We all of us go about, she meant to tell him but was too occupied, wanting to be wanted but unsure why anybody should bother.
Life is but love.
You can enter into the relationship whole and understand the value of why you are choosing to work in union with another. The relationship is a merger, not a buyout, meaning you wouldn’t come to another and desire to be in partnership to dominate and control the other person. You wouldn’t partner or merge with someone who you didn’t believe in their life’s work, or you don’t honor the work they’ve done to grow into who they currently are.
She wanted to hear more of Soledad geeking out, preferably while sticky and naked and trying to decide on pizza toppings.
The difference is that she loved him once and he loved her twice.
Love is intense. You break down all your walls to let someone in. But if they're not good for you, they can tear you up from the inside. And you think what you have together is love, so you let them.
When you readily throw words around like 'beautiful', 'gorgeous' and 'sexy'...Ensure the first person to hear them is the one who deserves them...
When someone needs something in order to feel better, that something returns her love.
When someone needs something in order to feel better, that something returns him love.
Several times over the years Kate would tell me how she saw Grady in her dreams. In the dream Kate would say to her, “You can't be here, Grady, you died.” Inevitably as she said that, Grady would disappear, poof, just like that. I tried to explain to her that she needed to accept Grady into her dreams. She needed to give Grady permission to stay. Until she did, Grady would have to honor what Kate believed to be true. When Kate said, “You can’t be here,” Grady could not stay. That’s the way it works. A loyal dog obeys its master, even beyond the grave.
If you have not resolved your grief, it will affect your future relationships including the one you have with yourself. Including the one you have with me. It will keep us all in a holding pattern, putting a straightjacket on your love and chaining you to the past instead of moving you forward into the future.
It struck her how a man could seem to gain a little bit of magic or grace or virtue with every woman he was with, but that a woman--though she said maybe should should be fair and just speak for herself--relinquished something each time, even if it ended mutually and well.
We remain stuck when we forget our original nature, and our original nature is pure and limitless, it isn’t bound or attached to our past, mistakes, or circumstances; it is free from emotion, it is clear, it is light. It is ever changing and because it is ever changing it is free from bondage – mental, physical, emotional and spiritual bondage.
Alignment is sacred, and everything that is sacred says that we're whole, but we must first honor our wholeness by doing the work within and releasing the wounds, releasing the karmic patterning of our parents, and releasing the relationships that we had before that taught us to think and feel in a certain way.
Surrendering is having an openness, it is a blossoming and encompasses the ability, to be honest, vulnerable, and trust another. Surrendering is not the same as giving into everything your partner says or throwing away your stance without reason. Surrendering is ending the resistance within you and the relationship as whole by coming together mutually and (w)holistically for the purpose of a greater understanding.
Men love those creatures that need to be taken care of. To be with a strong and wise woman is obliging. If you want to tame a lioness you need to become a lion, not a goat. A doe is easier to keep. You give her a little grass, a little milk, and she is tamed. Who do you think a man would choose?
Only those who look closely will see the beauty between her flaws.
When someone treats you like a shit, you’re nothing more than a shit in that person’s life. Stop fooling yourself.
No matter what they say, how they treat you is how they feel about you.
Why are you staring at me?'  the girl asked. The boy looked at her eyes. 'Because I wonder, of all the people in the world, why am I the lucky one who found you?
Her smile alone could light up the darkest of souls The scent of a harvest of roses Skin as soft as silk clothes  Energy explosive
When a woman allows a man to enter her he is either giving or taking vital energy. A man can only share vital energy if he possesses it. A man’s vitality lies in his inner work and reservation of his semen emissions, which contains vital energy, life force. Avoiding overly frequent ejaculations is key. Building your storehouse of vital energy takes maturity and discipline.
Cosmic love is your birthright. Meditative sensitivity opens you up to the higher realms of existence. The explosive cosmic and soul love we seek can only be experienced when your heart is fully open first.
Be true to who you are! Don't sit around waiting for approval, life is too short...DO what makes you happy!
If my beloved were a king, I couldst not love him more. Were he a jester to make men laugh, My love I would implore. But, alas, my love is but a man, Of heart and soul so free. And I couldst no more break my vow, Than break the heart in me.
Women who are not boring have realized that men do not like sex as much as it is generally believed.
I fell asleep with your head on my breast My soul laying gracefully on your stable and loving chest
Sacred sexuality is the marrying of souls.
The main differences between prostitution and most relationships are the lengths of the relationships and the methods of payment.
And you stop needing to have the experience of heartbreak when you realize you are already whole. If you are already love no one can come into your life and take away the love you’ve cultivated and become.
Some people make you realise how important relationships are and some relationships make you understand how important money is.
When you choose to work in partnership with another, it's saying, you recognize your partners worth and what you bring to each other, and that essentially they are you. By recognizing that they are a representation of you, you recognize your growth within them, and their invitation for you to grow to your highest aspect.
Those old hags downstairs were quite nauseating,' she said after another silence. 'I can't think why we stayed there listening to them. (You because you hunger for social contacts, however squalid. Me to lick the pebble of my unhappiness.)
Loving yourself is being aware of how you spend your time. Eliminating purposeless daily activities and prioritizing will free up your time in order for you to focus on living in purpose.
Being tired is a luxury that a working woman can't afford, which is why I did my best to keep it together, to maintain an impossible juggling act: work, shopping, phone calls - endless, endless phone calls.
Andrei wasn't just ideal - he was unique. I didn't need the rest of the world when I had him; you could disappear into him and forget who you were.
I believe in the unity of souls because I've seen it. I remember how my grandfather and grandmother lived together. But as for the rest, I know perfectly well how it will go, and how it will end.
I was going to be sick soon. I had certainly done some damage to the body while trying to numb the heart.
When I got home, I looked around and thought that it was about time for a good cry. A really serious one.
Sometimes I think that people are like stars or planets in the sky. Near each other, but unable to reach out and touch one another, even though they're sharing the same orbit. Spinning through the darkness so close together, they only see the outlines of unfamiliar figures. And they strain with all their might to reach each other, but gravity forces them into circle after circle of pointless motion in empty space.
It's hard for a woman to respect a man who refuses to take any action to solve his problems.
A mother's heart has the gift of foresight.
We often pray to the stars above, to help us find somebody to love.
True friendship is when you can allow and accept each other without conditions, ultimatums, expectations, demands or hidden agendas.
Love is to choose the same person every time you had choice to choose everyone else.
The Principles of Human Design   1. You are a unique being. The combination of who you are and why you are here is as unique as your finger prints.   2. It’s much easier to be who you really are than who you think you should be.   3. You are who you are and nothing can change that. You’re beautiful just as you are.  4. Human Design helps you remember who you are. You were born perfectly and nothing has changed.  5. Human Design is about making decisions that are right for you versus what’s right for anyone else.   6. You don’t need to be fixed. You’re perfect just the way you are.   7. You’re here for a reason. The world is waiting for the authentic you to emerge.   8. Human Design allows you to be the you you were born to be. You don’t need to take anything personally; it’s just energy.   9. If each one of us were living our unique Strategy, the world would be a lovely and very livable place.  10. You are designed to receive love and everything you need to survive. The Universe is always taking care of you by default, if you allow It.   11. Human Design is about Self-Awareness: getting to know yourself better so you can be happier, healthier, more prosperous and more fulfilled.   12. Things should flow easily when you’re living your design. There’s no pushing hard when you’re in the flow. Relationships, job offers, money, fulfillment will flow to you and through you naturally.
In all innocence I plead guilty for loving you by accident.
We need to realize that any individual, and generally it is someone that we call a boyfriend or girlfriend, lover, mate, husband, wife, friend, consort, or anyone that is getting us to learn more about ourselves, to see aspects of ourselves that we don’t typically like to see or want to see, is, in fact, our actual soul mate.
Distance does not affect the fact that we look at the same moon every night.
Reva often spoke about 'settling down.' That sounded like death to me.  'I'd rather be alone than anybody's live-in prostitute,' I said to Reva.
I belong to a culture that includes Proust, Henry James, Tchaikovsky, Cole Porter, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Alexander the Great, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Christopher Marlowe, Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Tennessee Williams, Byron, E.M. Forster, Lorca, Auden, Francis Bacon, James Baldwin, Harry Stack Sullivan, John Maynard Keynes, Dag Hammarskjold… These are not invisible men. Poor Bruce. Poor frightened Bruce. Once upon a time you wanted to be a soldier. Bruce, did you know that an openly gay Englishman was as responsible as any man for winning the Second World War? His name was Alan Turing and he cracked the Germans' Enigma code so the Allies knew in advance what the Nazis were going to do — and when the war was over he committed suicide he was so hounded for being gay. Why don't they teach any of this in the schools? If they did, maybe he wouldn't have killed himself and maybe you wouldn't be so terrified of who you are. The only way we'll have real pride is when we demand recognition of a culture that isn't just sexual. It's all there—all through history we've been there; but we have to claim it, and identify who was in it, and articulate what's in our minds and hearts and all our creative contributions to this earth. And until we do that, and until we organize ourselves block by neighborhood by city by state into a united visible community that fights back, we're doomed. That's how I want to be defined: as one of the men who fought the war.
A lot of disagreements are born from misunderstandings. Communication is key.
Most people shake your hand but only a few touch your heart.
Before the abuser initiates contact with a prospective long-term intimate partner he has already developed some very strong beliefs and attitudes. In his own mind he knows what he needs from an intimate relationship and he is convinced that he is entitled to have these needs met. He is also convinced that these needs outweigh any cost to his prospective partner.
Make time for those who make time for you. Treasure those who care enough to invest their time and energy. Friendship is for giving.
All this when I know human relationships are not founded on reason any more than my roses are fertilized with debate. I know seeking asylum behind the wall of intellect and rationality is a selfish retreating into self-protectiveness at the expense of another's well-being.
These tactics are initiated if the abuser wants to explore the possibility of a lasting relationship and if he feels that the particular woman would be susceptible to such tactics.
If you watch and pay attention, good or bad, people always reveal themselves.
Love is not special, lovers are!
It took seconds to fall in love and years to tell her.
I want to be the one who make stories, I want to hurt the way I get hurt, I want to experience how does it feel to be a cheater, a liar, a betrayer, to come up with quick stories to hide the faults, to know that I’ve hurt someone still blame the person for being mad but damn! I turn out to be the loyal one all the time who makes all the efforts to continue the relationship and stay honest and it hurts as fuck!
You realise power of money and love when you lose them. You realise power of money more when you lose love along with it!
There's no good reason why I shouldn't kiss you right now.
Donner Party Forsaken, fucking in the cold, eating each other, lost runny noses, complaining all the time like so many people that we know
We often hold on to someone who actually wants us to let go.
Even if you forget, I will remember for the two of us.
I don't think relationships are just about physicality. There are ways to show you care about someone, not just using your lips. Or any other part. (Lara Jean to Peter Kavinsky)
All this? It's a privilege to worship at this temple, do you understand my meaning? Not just any young fool can approach the throne. Remember my words, Lara Jean. You decide who, how far, and how often, if ever. (Stormy)
Stop assuming people can read your mind. Communicate yourself.
The only thing I'll say is, make your own friends. Peter will be making tons of friends because of lacrosse, and the people he'll be friends with aren't necessarily the kinds of people you'd pick to be friends with. So make your own friends. Find your people. (Margot to Lara Jean)
Never stop looking for the dream that could happen tomorrow.
My life began at the beginning with you.
Family is the foundation of life.
When does infidelity begin, Rachel wondered as she crossed the park at lunch time on her way for the afternoon shift at work. Does it start with a word? A look? A touch? When does it become too late to remain a faithful wife?
There was a fine-tuning of Richard's and my temperaments during the years we lived with his heart disease, lymphoma, and lung cancer. Before, our differences had triggered sporadic tension; now our basic natures served us better. Our sensibilities and quirks evolved into something more shared and complex, more mingled.
Like a wave we often float ashore to find something that feels like home.
My former girlfriend said: ‘You don’t deserve the house you have; it’s too good for you.’ I replied: “I found a house that matched all your criteria, to make you happy. If you lost it, and ended up sleeping in a filthy room in a shared apartment, is because you don’t deserve me, I was too good for you, you disappointed me by trying to find a guy that matches you better, and you made me very unhappy. Your priories were wrong.’ Life does not offer gifts or rewards, but opportunities. Nobody is entitled to anything. Only behavior and labor defines us and what we have. Whenever you make a choice, you follow one path and move apart from another. If your job occupies more importance in your mind, time and actions, than your dream, then you will not accomplish your dream but maybe receive a raise in your salary instead and be happy with that loss. If you look at relationships as a toy store, if you look at your companion as easily replaceable, then you will very likely lose the one you have. If you rather enjoy life with your friends than with your companion, you will end up alone. If you insult the wise, you then end up surrounded by fools. If you neglect your wealth, you will likely end up poor. If you destroy love, you will end up feeling unloved. If you destroy the good that comes to you, you will end up experiencing evil. Life will always reflect your actions, words and thoughts. You are what you spend most of your time doing, saying and thinking. Your life is always a reflection of your priorities. If you spend your time partying, insulting and occupying your mind with nonsense from social media, music with degrading lyrics, and movies that promote antisocial values, you get zero from life.
I hope when you experience deep sadness you have the courage to redirect your life  I hope you appreciate the value of time and never allow money to consume you
In England you learn only to compete with your men in the world and it's not enough to be loved for yourselves because you are women. I shall try to learn of you, but you must try to learn from me, <i>convenido?</i>
Everything in her life, she could see now, had taken the same turn—as for love, she often puzzled and puzzled, without ever allowing herself to be fully sad, as to what could be wrong with the formula. It does not work, she thought. At times there were moments when she asked herself if she could have been in the wrong: she would almost rather think that. What she <i>thought</i> she regretted was her lack of guard, her wayward extravagance—but had she all the time been more guarded than she imagined, had she been deceitful, had she been seen through? For what had always happened she could still not account. There seemed to be some way she did not know of by which people managed to understand each other.
A beautiful garden and a beautiful woman have much in common. They both bring peace and tranquillity to the man who is fortunate enough to possess them."  Rachel was silent. To be possessed by Jeronimo was a dream she could never aspire to, but she would remember his words for ever.
The relationship you have with yourself will determine what your relationships with others will be like.
At the point where you find yourself closing down from communicating openly in a relationship, you have a choice about how you would like to proceed. One way forward is to lay fresh layers of protection around your vulnerable heart. You are dampening the other person’s ability to hurt you, but you are also less able to communicate your own love genuinely. You are essentially preparing yourself for an inevitable breakup.  The alternative is loosening up your expectations and reconnecting with that curiosity you were able to offer at the beginning of the relationship. You commit to exploring where you are stuck, where you have put up that protective shielding, and how you can open yourself more to your partner. This is a way to deepen a relationship, by recommitting to applying gentle curiosity toward learning about your lover.
We are all potentially demons to each other, but some close relationships are saved from this fate.
It's not so easy."  "What isn't?"  "To establish relationships, you can't just elect people, it can't be done by thinking and willing.
Part of love is preparing for death. You feel confirmed in your love when she dies. You got it right. This is part of it all.
Her eyes are planets whose subjects aren’t subject to the laws of gravity.
Her body is a philosophical novel that proves the existence of extraterrestrial life forms.
Tease her with your touch or she’ll tase you with her absence.
I have felt more passion with less comfort elsewhere: the mysterious deep half-blind preferences of human beings for each other, the quick probing tentacles that seek in the dark, why one inexplicably and yet certainly loves A and is indifferent to B.
Christ, I loathe women. But I can't get going on the other tack either. And you needn't blush and look coy, I never fancied you. I know what you got up to with Fritzie Eitel! No—but I'd have had old Wilfred if he'd asked me. What did old Wilfred do for sex? No one ever knew. Perhaps he didn't have any, and if so good on him.
The trouble with you, Charles, is that basically you despise women, whereas I, in spite of some appearances to the contrary, do not."  "I don't despise women. I was in love with all Shakespeare's heroines before I was twelve."  "But they don't exist, dear man, that's the point. They live in the never-never land of art, all tricked out in Shakespeare's wit and wisdom, and mock us from there, filling us with false hopes and empty dreams. The real thing is spite and lies and arguments about money.
Love may not lead where we think or hope, but regardless of outcome it should be a call to seriousness and truth. If it is not that - if it is not moral in its effect - than love is no more than an exaggerated form of pleasure.
She’s a tornado in a tank top leaving wreckage in her wake.
Make love to her mind but don’t leave her mindfucked.
Relationships are constantly changing. They have to be dealt with every day anew. They are not constant, unchanging entities. You have to pay attention. If things take a turn for the worse then it is painful but it’s a chance to see things differently, a chance to see more. So that is a helpful pain.
Like a painting; you are art and I hope I can be a piece of it.
Close enough is not close enough.
So often when we are unhappy it is becasue we are taking too much responsibility or we are taking too little. Instead of being assertive and choosing clearly for ourselves, we might become aggressive (choosing for others) or passive (letting others choose for us), or passive-aggressive (choosing for others by preventing them from achieving what they are choosing for themselves).
Can you imagine being in a place inside of yourself where you genuinely don’t need to be loved? It’s a very quiet place in which your love becomes open, broad, beautiful, and strong.
In the beginning, the lovemaking was frequent and wild, but with little genuine feeling, like good pornography. Our true intimacy was the unspoken belief that we were living honest lives without the artifice and deceit so necessary in most relationships.
Loyalty is a choice you make to respect your partner, to realise the value of efforts one makes for you.. And that choice is easy to make when you love the person and understand how much the broken trust would hurt the person who loves you..
Don't you see we're all full of horrible power, working against each other however much we may love?
Bot even the truest of love can survive without respect.  Not even self love.
Your jagged edges always surrender to the soft lines in the face of my poetry.
i have a fatal attraction to your mismatched fragments &amp; your meaningless tangents seem to mean the world to me.
Ouch!: We can't control how pain and suffering enter our lives...we¹re all involved with other people for big chunks of our lives...And because people are complex critters, things get tangled, messy, and uncomfortable far faster and more often than anyone intends.
I wished to trust, and so I trusted. When events did not please me, my dreams reworked them.
You are acting as though there is a choice in who you love. It doesn’t really work that way. You love who you love.”  “Now you’re being ridiculous. Of course love is a choice.”  “Being in a relationship with someone is a choice. Loving them isn’t. There are plenty of people divorced today who still love one another. And there are a bunch of people out there who love someone with everything they have, but choose not to be with them because they’re addicts or they’re unreliable, or they cheated. The choosing to be with someone or not part, that is a choice. But who you end up falling for, that is completely out of your control.
Life is too short to spend your time pining for someone who isn't here.
love is not cruel we are cruel love is not a game we have made a game out of love
For it is only in other people's gaze that we see ourselves, isn't it?
Reaching so far out We've tripped and skipped  Reality
...as if, one lover gone, I was opening up for an immediate replacement. Smack habit, love habit - what's the difference? They can both kill you. For the bus journey I fell in love with a woman who smiled at me. The motion of the bus made her thick mop of fair curls tremble. We talked about desperados.   'I am fatally attracted to them', I said. 'In fact, I probably am one'.
A beau needs to love you for who you are, not who you're tryin' to be.
Beautiful things come together one stitch at a time.
Love is its own reward.
Oftentimes, it is for the better but most of the time, you'll see the product of pain sauntering down the sidewalk, spewing its manifestations to every individual who crosses their path.
They are out here treating love like it is War. But they are crazy because the only casualties are them! They are dead on the inside and they like being numb.
Lindy, you're not disappointed with Tim. You're disappointed by your own expectations.
Break up of relation ,sometime don't just breaks connection between two bodies , for someone it can be disconnect with the soul And disconnect with soul,  it's called "Death
Do you love her?”  “Fuck no. What the hell would make you ask that?”  “Do you want to take her home tonight instead of me?”  “No.”  “Then I don’t care.”  Jake backed me into the bar, his arms at my sides holding onto the ledge. “I love you.
Relationships are valuable for healing and learning how to love.
Such a relationship does not stay longer if that holds the intended hopes, and motives.
The more you love someone the more you become vulnerable to getting hurt
Relationships are created, love happens.
Your paths will never align if you do not have the ability to adapt.
Men and women have different dreams.' She lifted her head, looked at him and touched his face.  'And when you put them together, you have a life.' she kissed his mouth
Sure, military combat is scary... but in some ways combat seems a little easier than personal relationships. At least in combat, the enemy is honest enough to claim themselves as such.
There is always at least one person wondering if someone who has never loved them still loves them.
Love out of freewill is the purest of all. And this freewill means complete freedom, even the freedom to reject.
Delicate ties lead to a stronger love
Just like a vocal range, everybody has a feelings range: some people can hit the mood, others are feeling-deaf.
The quality of all your current relationships is a direct result of how you feel about yourself.
Some people I know should walk around with written warnings on, like the ones you find on cigarette packages.
Do not assume that someone else’s ego can love you. It cannot. It does not even love the person it resides in. The limit of the ego’s 'love' is to decide that you are a temporary ally and thus it will protect you for the benefit of its own use. Only a soul can accept and return love. Everything else is manipulation. Fragile arrangements. They are, at best, suspicious and, at worst, vicious.
It seems to be typical of life in America, where opportunities, real and fancied, are thicker than anywhere else on the globe, that the second generation has no time to talk to the first.
But it seems logical... a man and a woman have to be somewhat equal... as in, one of them can’t always be swooping in and saving the other one. They have to save each other equally. .... I can’t always be Lois Lane,” I insisted. “ I want to be Superman, too.
I’ve seen the way she comes on to him—I just can’t stand it. You know—what really shits me is how you spend years working on yourself to get rid of all that stupid eyelash-fluttering and giggling, and then just when you think you’re getting somewhere, you find out that guys still like women who do that sort of thing. I watch ‘em fall for it, every time.
Our never-ending dread has little bearing on the outside world. That is, unless and until it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Enter enough relationships already certain you will make them fail and you will make some fail. Predict you will drive everyone away and some will be driven away. Inertia. Reticence. Shuffling with heads hung low, avoiding eye contact, always apologizing, seeking reassurance but no amount is ever enough. To others, these habits of ours are exhausting and boring. Life with us is lots of work, Loving those who hate themselves is like swimming upstream: often more trouble than it is worth.
Many a woman secretly has a crush on a man who secretly has a crush on her man.
When my skin had gone back to its even tone I slept with another man and discovered, my hands lying awkwardly on the sheet at either side of me, that I had forgotten what to do with them. I'm responsible and an adult again, full time. What remains is that my sensation thermostat has been thrown out of whack; it's been years and sometimes I wonder whether my body will ever again register above lukewarm.
First coming aboard, a new arrival makes a cautious survey of the crew, trying to winnow the affable and good-natured from the surly and truculent. Some of the crewmen will seem easygoing, happy-go-lucky, good-fellows-all; others may appear to be reserved or even aloof. Yet I found that at the end of a voyage these aloof ones were often the persons whom I grew to like and respect the most, while those who seemed so agreeable turned out to be rascals.
He was sure: no one had ever caused her to feel that before. It felt like playing with fire.
I've often noticed that there is a moment when a man develops enough confidence and ease in a relationship to bore you to death. Sometimes one hardly even notices it's happened, that moment, until some careless remark arouses one's suspicions. I have found that what usually brings this lethargy on is if the woman displays some special kindness. Like making dinner.
He was a true danger incarnate. He was one of those men that the mothers advised their daughters to stay away from.
Looking at him felt like a torment. Her heart was beating faster with every second, trying to jump out of her chest. Fear and desire, before unknown, were coming over her like strong, powerful waves, breaking somewhere below her waist.
Her entire previous life had left her absolutely unprepared for this day. Or rather for this morning.
Two months and then he'll find another toy? Nellie was right. What is going to happen to me after?
His hands worked magic but his heart was cold as ice.
Arina had no idea what she wanted except that she wanted to be with him.
You know, when you come to think about it, it's a wonder women have anything to do with men at all, and no surprise that men have devised all kinds of schemes to bind women to them, like not giving them any money. If you had your choice of sleeping with a beautiful soft creature or a large hard one, which would you pick? I mean, if they both had the same amount of money?
You ran away from me and I'm not used to people running away from me.
He wanted Arina This thought filled her body with happiness. She was crazy!
Arina still remembered his hands holding her tight, not letting her escape.
When you were dealing with a person separated from everybody by an invisible thick glass wall - like a bubble where he didn't let anybody in - every little thing mattered.
He didn't like personal questions. But, to be fair, he never really asked them either.
The only thing remaining was to hang Arina in the Louvre like the Mona Lisa and forget that she was alive.
He studied her tastes and reactions - in food, sex, or music - as if he were drawing a map of the continent that he had just discovered.
Sometimes it takes a lot of Joe to find the Joe who’s right.
We all have dark times!
From a distance, every relationship is similar—an old story with a new face. But if you know how to really look at things—you’ll see that every man is the first man—and every place is Eden.
Must you constantly reduce everything to sex?
Hi. My name is Sue. Have some Gu, Let me put this under you.  IF you ask anyone who has ever taken a wilderness medicine course from me, this is how they remember me. This is what we say to someone we find injured or lost in the backcountry. Introduce yourself, add sugars and insulation to the patient.
Don't tell God how big your problems are. Tell your problems how big your God is.
I sometimes wish that the two of us would have first gotten to know each other later.
In his opinion, men fell into four categories: the gorgeous scoundrels, who had half of the female population swooning at their feet; the handsome good guys, who also encountered no difficulties in finding a partner; the ugly, but charming, who still had their fair share of success with the opposite sex. And then came the invisible ones. The men who were neither good-looking, nor ugly. The ones you saw once and failed to remember the next day. They were the nice guys. And he was one of them.
It’s this thing I have. I’m sorry if it scared you. I feel other people’s feelings. I imagine crumbling insides and splitting hearts, goodbyes that hang in the air before they break into tiny pieces. I hear words that aren’t said, the echoes of lonely hallways and hollow footsteps. I hear sobs that soak pillowcases when all the lights are out and the world is sleeping. I carry this inside of me, all of it.   I knew you paced the floor at night, trying to walk over all the things you didn’t want me to know. But I felt every wound you ever endured when I rested against you. I felt the ache that I have, deep inside of me, on your lips. Every time we kissed, I tasted a lifetime of tangled paths and bumpy roads woven with joined hands. Love isn’t blind, you see. I felt everything you were and could be, if only you stopped hiding in the same darkness you sheltered me from. I knew who you could become if someone loved you just right. I’m sorry if that scared you.  Just in case you were wondering, I still love you and I'll keep the lights dim.  Come home.
I see the echo in your eyes &amp; your beautiful voice still causes my mind to dance in circles around my heart, enticing it to rise &amp; love again.
I’ll pour my life into your hands like oceans upon your sands if you can always stand to take a little more of me.
She was his Eve. He was her fall. He'd make the leaves of her trees blush, then he'd undress them all.
Passion is the essence of sensual living.
I used to wonder if we were destined to fail from the start, two people who lived hard and loved fast. Afraid to slow down. But now I know that my fingers weren’t long enough to reach your wounds, to caress the places that ached from the sharp words and careless actions of others. People had confused your gentleness for weakness. You carried everything heavy.   Had I known, I would have danced delicate language all around you. I would’ve told you that your internal brightness illuminated mine. And that I only saw the beauty in myself when I looked at my reflection in your eyes. If only I had known that behind that strong gaze was everything else. Everything you didn’t want me to know. Your shine came from what you felt when you looked at me. And you feared that I would be yet another to use your light and leave you alone. In even more darkness. But I wouldn’t have. I didn’t know how to tell you, but I know that pain too.
The universe blew god a stranger's kiss. Earth landed softly upon infinity's lips. He's been dying to know her better ever since.
If I could count the infinity of you I’d place each second within your soul, and lay my breath between the stars that form your heart and whole.
A father must be good to his wife and daughter, because from watching this treatment — the son will learn how to treat all women, and his daughter will know what a good man is supposed to act like. And a mother must always remain morally good and faithful to her husband, be attentive to all her children, and be filled with patience, forgiveness, kind words, compassion and love — so her children are raised to respect all mothers, and know what a good woman is supposed to act like. If you neglect your fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, husbands, and wives, then don't be surprised when the Creator is forced to neglect you. Neglect, and you will be neglected. Protect, and you will be protected. Reject, and you will be rejected. Love all, and all that love will be mirrored by the Creator — and reflected back onto YOU.
As I got older, I started to cut out food that was bad for me. As I got wiser, I did the same with people.
We light up around anyone who makes us feel screwed in, to the universe.
The universe blew me a kiss &amp; you landed upon my lips, love.
Your eyes border on the miraculous the way they resurrect my smile.
To lovers out there…  Love is blind. It does not see any skin color, It does not see any body structure or body height It does not see if you are rich or poor It does not see if you stay close or stay far It does not see if you are educated or not  Love the person you love without any doubt, irregardless who says what.  Love does not have limits, parameters, boundaries or imperfections. When you make a decision to love someone then truly love them without hesitation. Love is for all. Everyone deserve to be loved, no matter who they are or how they are. Everyone deserve to be given a chance to express themselves.
When she leaves me, I thought I lost my world, but actually, I found my universe.
You are not the first man to miss a woman's more subtle communication. They think they are waving when we see only the calm sea, and pretty soon everybody drowns.
What fundamentally differentiates men from women is the functions of desires.
A deep friendship can keep a partner from jumping to negative conclusions when another partner says or does something that sounds derogatory and hurtful. It may be a wellspring of trust, a key ingredient of successful partnerships. True friendship can help one partner to be understanding when another has family problems that wind up shortchanging the business for an extended period of time. A strong bond of friendship may be a sign of shared values and can be the glue that holds partners together when the business is under stress.

He's giving me that look - sympathetic but also exasperated and mystified, like How is it possible that my sane and reasonable DNA created such a crazy daughter?
People and friends come and go as we learn and grow.
True greatness extends beyond your presence into your absence.
Sometimes I find myself arguing with her hips because her walk is so mean.
Your alternate dimension keeps crashing into this one &amp; love's got me experiencing symptoms without ever getting sick of you.
Fly away,” sang little lark to the crow, “There is no home for you Among the broken promises and empty hearts. We drew the life we never mourned, away with fading dark. Your wings are fashioned from the cold, mindless lies of feathers tarred with pitch!
Ladies, if you think he’s a loser, don’t marry him, unless he shows you he's a winner.
We don't even know about them 'cause we won't even look at them or even talk to them.
Let’s understand a person’s background, before we condemn their behavior.
I remember that summer we walked up the hill, sat atop on the rocks with time to kill; we let sweet red wine set us aglow, then four drunken eyes watched the sunset show  I felt the colors enter my veins: warm light-pink shining golden rays; if there was a hue for happiness, I'm sure I saw it with you then
The fall of your hair is rushing through my head like elegant waterfalls repeatedly dancing down into an open riverbed.
She was a southern girl, which is the same as saying she was insane. All southern women are insane. Some are cold blooded killers and some are harmless eccentrics, but the best of the breed exhibit both of these characteristics and always the one you expect the least at the time you least expect it.
A deep connection is a level where you are operating at your highest sensual frequency.
Love, like individuals, is tested by the flame of adversity. If we are faithful and determined, it will temper and refine us, but it will not consume us. Enjoy what you now have. Be a disciple of Christ. Live worthily of marriage even if it doesn't come soon. And cherish it with all your heart when it does.
left brain - right brain: he's a pro; played my heart like a harp before I came to know. He got me strung so he could pluck my strings for the kicks; 'cause he's a polymath musician and I'm just a side gig
Both times it was loneliness, and the night, and panic afterwards.
In this jangle of causes and effects, what had become of their true selves? Here Leonard lay dead in the garden, from natural causes; yet life was a deep, deep river, death a blue sky, life was a house, death a wisp of hay, a flower, a tower, life and death were anything and everything, except this ordered insanity, where the king takes the queen, and the ace the king. Ah, no; there was beauty and adventure behind, such as the man at her feet had yearned for; there was hope this side of the grave; there were truer relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now. As a prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning, so she, from the turmoil and horror of those days, caught glimpses of the diviner wheels.
I don't know how to care for you and care for me simultaneously. I don't know how to love you out loud without losing myself in the sound.
fire turns to flickering spark; I don't know if we'll last the dark; I tell you now to walk away; nobody can get me to stay
I think of you and think of love; when all I knew to do was run; though this is now and that was then; I know I'd do it all again
you came over every week to touch me; traced my body with your tongue till we saw sunrise; and we ate burgers in bed naked; watched The Bee Movie; talked philosophy; sipped red wine; played catch with an orange; I asked you to tell me all your secrets.
Now he's got me hooked and hanging on a fragile thread; How I overlooked the ending: he just wants me dead. I can't let go, he's got control; I'll never be so foolish again to fall in love in love with a fisherman.
And now when I delete your iMessages, they show up in an 'Archive'. They live on in 'The Cloud', floating somewhere up there in space.  It is hard to move on with the knowledge that somewhere up there in space: we are alive amongst the satellites.
left brain - right brain: show me the way; don't know whether to go or stay. left brain - right brain: is this a test? my heart says touch him by my head knows best
Helen forgot people. They were husks that had enclosed her emotion.
you made it crystal clear; you don't want to be here. why are you still knocking on my door? the season has changed and I'm still trying to displace your presence; still trying to erase your essence. you left your belongings for me to discard. my sheets still smell like the walls of your heart.
Personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever, and not this outer life of telegrams and anger.
In other words, they belong to types that could fall in love, but couldn't live together.
It's a fact, and principle, that women who are most in touch with their sensuality easily inspire a deep level of commitment in men. As a result, they are often the quickest to get married.
Sensuality is a candle of passion that forever burns within us. But it's also a wildfire to some of us.
A ship in a harbour is a safe ship, but that's not what ships are built for. In the same way, a woman in a good relationship feels safe. But truth is, she innately knows she was not built for unnecessary safety, but rather for a sea of passion.
Here is the thing, I don't want you to think that this is about men per se. Yes, men are a part of it, but not everything about your sensuality is about men. In essence, this is about you living your most passionate life as a woman... FOR YOU, first and foremost.
One of your curls could fall striking me with the genius of a million masterpieces without you even noticing the violent storms of my love.
Words to feed your passion. Thought to stoke your flickering embers. I see your unseen fires &amp; feed it with my timber.
You breathe into my words &amp; animate them with life. I'd fall from heaven a trillion times over to die in the softness of your paradise.
Her thought drew being from the obscure borderland. She could not explain in so many words, but she felt that those who prepare for all the emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy. It is necessary to prepare for an examination, or a dinner-party, or a possible fall in the price of stock: those who attempt human relations must adopt another method or fail.
She was a southern girl, which is the same as saying she was insane.
God is the Designer and Chief Engineer of human relationships.
Si je revois un jour Sophie, je le lui dirai : rien n'est plus cruel que le silence puisqu'il laisse subsister l'espérance tout à la décevant toujours.
I’m realizing it doesn’t really matter if we have a happy ending or not. We’re happy right now. That’s the important part, right?
I'm not here to make you comfortable, I'm here to make you passionate.
My dog is always happy to see me, no matter what. We could all learn a thing or two from our four legged friends.
There's something about first love...it's untouchable to those who played no part in it. But it's the measure of all that follows.
Give her reason to love you, and not leave you.
We live in a culture that teaches us that "men" are the sexual aggressors and pursuers. We also live in a world where most women, trans, and non-binary folks have had negative experiences with men who are hitting on them. These factors tend to lead to some big gender differences for those exploring non-monogamy.  Cisgender men often struggle when they first enter the world of non-monogamy. Within consensual non-monogamy (CNM) communities, most folks who sleep with cis men choose their partners based on referrals and endorsements. As in the world of business, it truly is who you know. Cis men who have been in the communities longer have dated and interacted with more people, and, therefore, have more word of mouth. It is an unfortunate reality that many, especially cisgender women, will not date men they don't already know about through their friends and communities.  So, if you're a cis man exploring CNM, expect that it may take a while before you start seeing the kind of attention that others get. Focus on being kind, respectful, and honest. Respect the needs and boundaries of everyone with whom you interact. Spend lots of time getting to know other people simply as people - especially of your preferred gender to date - and form genuine friendships and connections with them free from any pressure to become sexual.
Some relationships can kill off love just as surely as crushing a flower.
But even if that happens - that doesn’t take away anything that happened before. The present. The fun you’ll have, everything you’ll learn about yourself. Nothing will take that away. So is it worth it? You’re damned right it’s worth it.
It's not about the sex, exactly. It's the other stuff. Here's the truth: I want ths so badly, To the point where it's almost physically painful sometimes. I want Olivia's soft voiced conversations with Evan Schulmeister, where she takes five steps away from us before she even answers the phone. Just to be alone with him. And I want the palpable waves of electric crush energy that radiate off Cassie these days. I want to know what it feels like to have crushes that could conceivably one day turn into boyfriends.
One evening, we were sitting in his apartment, and he says, ‘Little friend, by now you know what I’m like. I am basically not a very convenient person.’ And then he went on to describe himself: not a talker, can be pretty harsh, can hurt your feelings, and so on. Not a good person to spend your life with. And he goes on. ‘Over the course of three and a half years you’ve probably made up your mind.’ I realized we were probably breaking up. So I said, ‘Well, yes, I’ve made up my mind.’ And he said, with doubt in his voice, ‘Really?’ That’s when I knew we were definitely breaking up. ‘In that case,’ he said, “I love you and I propose we get married on such and such a day.’ And that was completely unexpected.
Some people are so broken they get mad at you for being whole.
I'm still me, I want to say to him, your son, but that would hardly help if I am currently everything wrong with the world.
I'll be honest with you, the number one reason for all of my past break ups was too much complacency. I'm not perfect, but I just know I'm not cut out for mediocrity in any shape or form. Moreover, I think this has a lot to do with my life purpose as well. I believe I was not brought into this world to turn complacent women into passionate women, but rather to turn passionate women into goddesses.
If we take care of the good stuff there, then the good stuff here is much easier to get.
Would it last until they were senile?  Hard to say. They had been through trial by fire, and it would either forge them like iron or break them apart like untempered glass.  But there was this: They both desired the same thing. They wanted to be loved for who they were.  They just had to discover who they were beneath the habits of foray and retreat.
When we react vindictively, we create a mood and an attitude within ourselves that WE have to live with.
Relationships will always be valued by how each person feels in that relationship.
There's enough warmth of heart between us to live in harmony, Tom. But upon such subjects as we cannot agree, we must be silent.
A beautiful life is not a place at which you arrive, but the experience you create moment by moment.
Operate less from a place of force and more from a place of trust
We never belonged to a country we could sell out.'  By the time Jeong-il made that declaration, he had achieved perfect grades and attendance for eight years running, could correctly pronounce 'certainly' in English, explain the present perfect tense, and read and write cursive letters. Not to mention he had never shoplifted, shaken anyone down for money, or gotten in a fistfight. He avoided people altogether. Jeong-il was always alone. Even the teachers didn't know how to relate to him. None of my other friends tried to get to know him either.
If your beliefs offend others it's their problem don't make it yours  If their beliefs offend you it's your problem get over yourself  If your beliefs can't stand up to question have strength of character to reevaluate them  If their beliefs can't stand up to your questions show grace &amp; humility not to throw it in their face  If you let any belief get in the way of any relationship you don't understand the purpose of one or the value of the other.
In relationships luck has no meaning, are you lucky if you can leave her, or unlucky?
Being in a relationship, that’s something you choose. Being friends, that’s just something you are. I’d pick you. Fuck it, I do pick you. I want you to come over to my house in twenty years with your dude and your adopted kids and I want our fucking kids to hang out and I want to, like, drink wine and talk about the Middle East or whatever the fuck we’re gonna do when we’re old. We’ve been friends too long to pick, but if we could pick, I’d pick you.
See over there, I can be me, he says. I smile but it makes me sad. I haven't found any safe spaces. Damien says, you're safe with me. Until I'm not. He raises an eyebrow. With you I mean, I add. I dream about an internship on the West Coast, but there is nothing for me to do. I am not the president's daughter. I've never met a movie star. I barely watch television.
There is no one to laugh with about his cookies and milk, to gush about the fact that he is eighteen like I am eighteen only he seems much older.
Pause, take a deep breath and start again when you feel all your efforts are in vain. Pause and lift your spirits and forgive all over, when you feel your relations are gonna end forever. If at first, you don't succeed, don't lose hope, pause! try again! and proceed. when everything around seems going away, give your heart and mind a pause and sway. The wind will take you far when you lay, remember to let your thoughts linger on the way. A pause can do wonders, can save you from creating blunders. It saves you from telling a lie, your ego to reach the sky. Pause before you react and you fight, it will make your life shining bright.
. . . forgive me If you are not living if you, my beloved, my love if you have died, all the leaves will fall on my breast it will rain upon my soul night and day the snow will burn my heart, I shall walk with cold and fire and death and snow my feet will want to march toward where you sleep, but  I shall go on living . . .
Love and happiness don’t sustain a relationship, but it is your relationship that sustains your love and happiness” 
It’s amazing that relationships can form and last under the constraints of never fully knowing. Never knowing for sure what the other person is thinking. Never knowing for sure who a person is.
It wasn’t just the loss of people I had known but also the loss of myself. The loss of who I had been when I had been with them.
We know that whether something is considered beautiful or ugly is in the eye of the beholder. What’s more revealing is that the beholder’s determination of what is beautiful and what is ugly is a valuable insight into the soul and psyche of that person. The beauty and the beast are mirrors. It’s never actually about the object; it’s really about us. Every person, situation, and idea is an interaction between the observer and the observed, and therefore, a potential source of knowledge. Every encounter is an opportunity to learn, not just about the object but about ourselves. Every encounter is therefore an opportunity to evolve. If we pay attention!
You alone caan create the change you seek. But how? By accepting things as they are, you allow yourself to make apt choices.
There are different levels of trust, and I need to get back to the point where he trusts me so much he no longer has to say it aloud.
Believe in yourself that you can create the change you seek, by accepting things as they are. By accepting the things as they are, you allow yourself to make the right choices.
This would be the structure of the "successful" couple: a little prohibition, a good deal of play; to designate desire and then to leave it alone, like those obliging natives who show you the path but don't insist on accompanying you on your way.
We do not have control over many things in life and death but we do have control over the meaning we give it.
We do not "get over" a death. We learn to carry the grief and integrate the loss in our lives. In our hearts, we carry those who have died. We grieve and we love. We remember.
Honestly, death took on a totally different meaning for me in the past years.....I don't feel the fear or trepidation about death that I used to feel. I felt tired of living.
Grieving is intense and it is non-stop intense. Even if things are quiet, and you're sitting there in your chair, kind of staring off into space, inside, the intensity is raging. - Lori Ennis
The true act of mourning is not to suffer from the loss of the loved object; it is to discern one day, on the skin of the relationship, a certain tiny stain, appearing there as the symptom of a certain death : for the first time I am doing harm to the one I love, involuntarily, of course, but without panic.
It's important to remember that Israel's story is a story of being <i>in the process of getting to know God,</i> all before Jesus presents himself as the ultimate revelation of God. It is not unlike other relationships where we need time to fully understand and appreciate the true self and identity of the other person in the relationship. The story involves moments when Israel truly sees God, and moments when they profoundly misunderstand God--both of which are normal parts of any relationship.
Just because we lost a life, doesn't mean we have to lose ourselves. - Tamara Gabriel
There is no right way to grieve; there is only your way to grieve and that is different for everyone.
There are many different ways in which individuals express, experience, and adapt to grief. Understanding and accepting different ways of grieving lies at the heart of surviving your loss as a couple. Understanding is helpful but not absolutely necessary. Acceptance of your partner's approach however is a necessity. If you have not reached acceptance, make it your first priority.
The best advice that I got during counseling: Don't judge your spouse's grief response. Give them the freedom to grieve their own way. - Rachel Crawford
When my wife and I lost our son, we had similar but very different experiences. She felt she was caught in a blizzard and she doesn't remember the six months after we lost him. For me, it was like everything that I had known burnt to the ground, this field or forest that was turned to ash, burning, smoldering. How do I make sense of a world where this can happen? - Sean Hanish
Trust your partner's way of coping to be the best they are able to do and be at every moment in time.
The world is supposed to be full of possibilities, but they narrow down to pretty few in most personal experience. There's lots of good fish in the sea . . . maybe . . . but the vast masses seem to be mackerel or herring, and if you're not mackerel or herring yourself, you are likely to find very few good fish in the sea.
I don't think we had a joint mission to keep our relationship together. It was like: "Every man for himself." I was in so much pain, I wasn't really looking out for your interests. I didn't have the facility or resource to really do that, to be there for you. Thankfully everything held together. Our love for each other kept on a progression. It could have easily gone the other way." - Jonathan Pascual
When he walked out of my life after three years, he was the same person who had entered my life three years earlier. I’d formed an image out of my perception. I thought he was what I wanted him to be.
She was to be content to weave a steady life with him, all one fabric, but perhaps brocaded with the occasional flower of an adventure. But how could she know what she would feel next year? How could one ever know? How could one say Yes? for years and years? The little yes, gone on a breath! Why should one be pinned down by that butterfly word? Of course it had to flutter away and be gone, to be followed by other yes's and no's! Like the straying of butterflies.
She wasted my heart, my time.
Love imposes obligations and these are constant. An intermittent lover is no use to a person of dignity and courage.
When people split up, it always ricocheted like a fucking bullet, ripping through everyone who happened to be close by.
Things, once gone, can’t be put back; he knew that now. A punch, once delivered, can’t be withdrawn. Words, once spoken, can’t be unsaid. We may go on as if nothing has been lost, nothing done, nothing said; we may claim to forget it all; but our innermost core doesn’t forget, because we have been changed for ever.
All mature adults must accept that they are essentially unknowable--and that they will never know the one they love. Even when we kiss there is distance; it is a distance that cannot be bridged by romantic love and must be respected if a relationship is to succeed. The real metric by which we can gauge the authenticity of love is not how close we want to be, how merged and intermingled, but how far we can stand apart and still be together.
Isn’t that why we commit to another? It’s not for sex. If it were for sex, we wouldn’t marry one person. We’d just keep finding new partners. We commit for many reasons, I know, but the more I think about it, the more I think long-term relationships are for getting to know someone.
Maybe that’s how we know when a relationship is real. When someone else previously unconnected to us knows us in a way we never thought or believed possible.
I don't want you to take me places, I want you to back me up so I can get there myself!
For Proust, an injection of jealousy is the only thing capable of rescuing a relationship ruined by habit.
Looking for my final love with someone who is ready to settle down. Of course dating is great initially, but I don’t wish to be dating indefinitely, so if you’re looking for an indefinite dating partner, please pass me by.
She pulled away and walked to my bedroom and closed herself in with a little click of the knob. I could have pursued her. A paper clip could best the catch, but when a woman shuts you out, picking the lock won’t let you back in.
Authenticity comes from being true to the moment, in the moment.
They do not deserve you, if they desert you in times of distress.
Can I get two coffees?’  Joanna cringed. That cashier ought to tell her straight that she may have two coffees, but she certainly can’t get them because customers aren’t allowed behind the counter!
Your relationship with yourself is and always will be directly reflected in all your relationships with others.
Look at yourself for a change! You’ll be counting the grains of rice I buy next! Talk about tight – Scrooge has nothing on you!
Conscious of the way spinach has a habit of flaunting itself between front teeth, she packed tooth picks in her new clutch bag.
Remember what he said about my picture: I’m lovely and it made him do double cartwheels. Remember also that he’s prone to hyperbole, so don’t take everything he says literally.
Joanna swooned on hearing his voice and knew immediately that she would more than merely like him. Could be love at first type, she thought. It was a voice so luscious that only a hunk of a dreamboat could possess
I was dying inside because I couldn't have the one I wanted and crying because he didn't want me and because he wasn't what I needed.  But I was living inside because I had the one I needed and smiling because I was what he wanted and because I was what he needed.  Once you realize that having what you need, is in what wants and needs you, and is where the real love is found, though embedded deeply in the mind body and soul of your other half ....like hidden jewels...precious stones, untrodden roads, hidden pathways, tranquil parks and undiscovered wonders of the world; by which you create bonds through life experiences, whereby the reward is happiness; you realize that you behold the beauty of what love really is.   You then know that you have something preeminent in the palm of your hand. And that revelation, that ephiphamy, is a sign of growth, in that you are ordained to a horizontal equivalent, by virtue of bountifully maturing enough into a quintessential frame of mind, where you have the mental capacity and obligatory wherewithal to handle the authority of love. You've truly arrived to the most profound place, because you now know that you do have what you want- because all we want is to love and to be love.   The substance is never found on the surface. Not the good substance. The only substance that sits in such a shallow place is more than likely something toxic.   The real substance is at the bottom of the sea. That's where the mystery unfolds. The deepest part of your heart is like the deepest part of the ocean, and when someone is brave enough to go there, it's worth sharing the treasures buried deeply within.
The ability to talk to people: that’s the key to the world. It doesn’t matter whether you are able to articulate your own thoughts and feelings and meanings or not. What matters is being able to make the noises that encourage others to feel comfortable, and the inquiries which present them with the opportunity to articulate their thoughts and feelings and meanings, the particulars of their existences, their passions, preoccupations, beliefs. If you can talk to people in this way, you can go - you can get - anywhere in this world, in life.
In the end, as long as we were shouting at each other, we weren't done. We weren't over.
It is our greatest desire to see our own ideas of perfection manifest, but we must be open to the idea that God's perfection may not look the way we want it to.
May the love we have for each other be a perfect reflection of the love God has for us.
If you want her respect, do not disrespect her feelings.
Time and distance Both illusions of the mind No beginnings, no ends
The 2 biggest mistakes we make in relationships are mistaking lust for love in the beginning and mistaking habit for happiness in the end.
Thank you,” she murmured drowsily against Tyler’s warm chest. “For what?” he looked down at her, his green eyes shining like the stars. “For loving me.
So den we gittee married by de license, but I doan love my wife no mo' wid de license than I love her befo' de license. She a good woman and I love her all de time. (Oluale Kossula)
Love is a trap and only reveals itself to us by making us suffer.
When you come to live with a woman, you will soon cease to see anything of what made you love; though it is true that the two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy.
The child, a little girl with bare legs and long golden curls, was a being perfectly foreign to him, chiefly because she was trained quite otherwise than he wished her to be. There sprang up between the husband and wife the usual misunderstanding, without even the wish to understand each other, and then a silent warfare, hidden from outsiders and tempered by decorum.
We ran our brokenness against each other, in pure abandon. I knew you weren’t in it for the long run. I could feel it in the yearning of our bodies, the way our skin merged with desperation over and over, the way we held on too tight. I knew you weren’t the answer to my loneliness or the cure for all that ailed me, but you changed my life. You helped me realize that I could love again. And for that I am thankful. So thankful.
People play games, the whole damned thing's a game. And friends are just a part of it. They lie, they pretend to know you, to get you. They even pretend to love you, sometimes. But they leave, they always do, in the end. You can try all you want. But I promise you, if there's one thing I know for sure about people, it's that they leave.
When you come to live with a woman, you will soon cease to see anything of what made you love her; though it is true that the two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy.
Most men do not have the balls to help their women to not need them.
Beyond anything we know to name, there moves a force arising from the pure juxtaposition of things, a force that draws us into being, that allows us to dwell fully in our lives. All pure juxtaposition is a gathering.
Everyone has their love story. Everyone. It may have been a fiasco, it may have fizzled out, it may never even have got going, it may have been all in the mind, that doesn't make it any less real. Sometimes, it makes it more real. Sometimes, you see a couple, and they seem bored witless with one another, and you can't imagine them having anything in common, or why they're still living together. But it's not just habit or complacency or convention or anything like that. It's because once, they had their love story. Everyone does. It's the only story.
One particularly harmful idea carried by our cultural narrative is that you need to find someone who will love you. Imagine if we believed this about any other basic need: food, water, oxygen. If you needed another person to provide you with those, you’d be considered dependent—if not disabled. Yet we so willingly put ourselves in this state with love.
Trevor, make sure your woman is the woman in your life. Don't be one of those men who makes his wife compete with his mother. A man with a wife cannot be beholden to his mother.
You're still in it. You'll always be in it. No, not literally. But in your heart. Nothing ever ends, not if it's gone that deep. You'll always be walking wounded. That's the only choice, after a while. Walking wounded, or dead. Don't you agree?
They told me to pay attention to my heart; that it would lead me to my purpose, my passion. So, I did, I listened closely to the timbre of my heart and it always brought me back to you.
Your body captured my attention, but it was your soul that held my gaze.
He watered my soul with love and attention, respect and adoration. He nourished my mind with intellectual stimulation.
Electric interaction arose from our skin. I was learning him, he was discovering me.
Once you fall in love with her, you'll never recover.
Substance abuse is a very real trap. Drugs and alcohol are very much like an abusive lover who treats you well at first and then beats you up, apologizes, gives you nice treatment for a while, and then beats you up again. The trap is in trying to hang in there for the good while trying to overlook the bad. Wrong. This can never work.
Please let me know if I have missed any spots, because my soul yearns to know all of you, each and every part. I want your naked soul or nothing at all.
Sometimes you must let people go because their pieces no longer fit. This departure is for the betterment of your energy, your space and your precious life.
How can a man whose eyes are so close together be trusted?
You were a storm I chased to get my kicks and have some fun; it backfired when I crashed hard in love.
Forbidden things— my God, I’m drawn to them like a moth to a flame.
If I should get lost in all the chaos of the world, pull out your firefly net and catch me in the beauty of your tender love.
Sometimes she’s the gentle rain caressing you softly. Sometimes she’s the hurricane loving you madly.
Broken hearts make beautiful wings.
She had that autumn look in her eyes inviting and dangerous something about her you wanted to love something about her a warning to run.
If love doesn’t both weaken and strengthen us simultaneously, we are doing it wrong.
I made him the hero in my story and the center of my life.
You are the one addiction I can’t quite shake. You stimulate my mind and increase my heart rate.
She glanced admiringly at Volkov, a brief but encompassing appraisal. Her furtive scrutiny of Jack lingered longer.
Were these my options? Easy lay or mental? A lie, or alone? Were these the only options boys gave you? Was it mental to want someone to love you? Was it mental to want to be courted before a guy but an actual piece of his body inside your body? Was it mental to want a message after you’d kissed someone? Was it mental to want the most normal thing in the world- a relationship? One that didn’t make your heart feel full of bogeys?
That is the thing about love, it never leaves even when it goes.
I love the mystery of you. Wonder if I would love the reality, too.
Believe me when I confess I am comfortable with the madness in you.
Certain words, certain expressions. Things like ‘I love you’ and ‘I hate you.’ They’re big traps for actors. They can tempt you away from the connection you’ve developed with your partner and lead you into swamplands of clichéd performing. ‘Love’ and ‘hate’ are powerful words, and for some reason, we feel like we must fulfill them—and other words like them—whenever we say them. But we don’t have to.”  Bill turns to Adam. “Actors hit that line—‘you know I’m absolutely crazy about you. Don’t you?’—and go all kablooey. Your head’s saying, ‘How can I not say a line like that without letting love swim into the duck pond? But inside you’re saying, ‘To hell will love! This girl’s really pissed me off, breaking off an important date like that.’ Follow your true inner response. It will never lead you astray. You’ll be bubbling up with impatience and irritation and you’ll say a line like that and it’ll have new meaning. It’ll have your meaning. Remember: Bad actors consciously adjust their inner responses to what they think the lines of the text require. Good actors adjust the text to the inner emotional line created by their sensitized responses to the other actor.”  Adam says, “I get it. I was trying to act the words.”  Bill nods. “You were manipulating yourself, cutting off our real response in order to live up to what you thought the text demanded of you. But any line can mean anything, and come out of you in any way.
But that was the nature of relationships: there always seemed to be an imbalance of one sort or another.
Sometimes I find myself in the eye of my own hurricane.… He was trouble in my life interrupting my world crashing into my dreams but I was a fucking storm the lightening to his thunder so, what more could a little chaos add but a beautiful catastrophic eruption.
Suddenly, two shooting stars collided. Our souls merged.
Their eyes met, their souls locked, you could feel heat as the love between them caught fire as an explosion of two souls bursting in the atmosphere.
Love does not always make perfect sense; that does not make it any less real, that does not make it any less ours.
Some blazes can’t be extinguished; some forces can’t be controlled. And I will love you whether you want me to or not. There is no other way for me to exist without love, the soul bursting, heart-exploding kind of powerful magnetic love we crave.
There were many who charmed her, but only one who truly understood her mind, graced her heart, and made her feel deliciously delirious. When that lovely soul kissed her soul, her heart became a thousand times more beautiful.
Your love feels like a fresh start and tastes like I want forever with you.
Take me to that special place where you kiss me and the world forgets to exist fears evaporate insecurities obliterate.
Pour yourself a cup of steaming coffee, honey, then come pour yourself into me. I need you like you need your morning fix. You need me to breathe. And today, I need you to love me like the moon loves the fearless sea. Love is the only thing that will heal our tormented hearts. Love is the only thing that will set us free.
I want your lips upon my mouth to breathe you in and keep you there to sink my teeth into your skin to feel your soul and taste your mind
Some days she is delicate, vulnerable and soft. Other days she is a lioness; courageous, determined, unafraid. Always she is a goddess, a tenacious warrior’s heart. She is you, him and her. No one is without flaws, yet we are all flawless. Quite the contraction, still, so very true. Never underestimate your worth your beauty or your strength. You are everything you can imagine and so much more.
Our souls collided long before we were born wrapped in human skin. Now, all these light years later we meet again, this time with eyes and mouths and flesh and skin. We touch, we kiss, we laugh, we love. Soul on soul, flesh on flesh. When we kiss it is as if every language converges into one universal tongue, and I swear I hear angels applaud and see the devil smiling. Galaxies intersect, even heaven and hell unite. The sun, the stars, the moon, oh how we mesh, we do!
He has dirty hands and dark wild eyes, but by far he is the purest heart I have ever known. My eyes saw you, but damn, did my soul feel you.
But what is this psychic space, this common ground we seek to share, called intimacy - this place where you can exist in your own inner light and not be judged, this haven where your vulnerabilities don't humiliate you, where sex is always warm and close and all your funny lines are understood, and there is always someone back to back with you when you take on the world?  It's a place where not only joy can be shared but hardship too, it's an eye that catches yours across a room, it's not having to look your best, it's knowing someone else so well you can no longer tell where they begin and you leave off.
He felt like sin but tasted like love so, what’s a clumsy girl to do but stumble in delicious rapturous love.
And they say that there is no intimacy unless there is mutual acceptance and mutual trust, no matter whatever else there is, and I would side with them.
You didn’t waltz into my life like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing on air. Quite the contrary, you made a crash landing in the center of my heart, blazing guns and glory.
Possess me with your love Wholly, completely, devour me. Call me selfish, this is how I demand my lovers. Soul on soul, flesh on flesh, nothing less.
Power is anathema to intimacy, as it is to love, because when you have power, you have fear. So if you are trying to get closer to someone than you are right now, try recognizing their power rather than showing them yours.
There is hungry desperation in a lover’s kiss when it is enamored in love and I am famished for the depth of your soul your body’s intoxicating embrace.
Take me to that special place where the sea becomes the sky where day fades into night so easily when we kiss.
Romantic love has highs and lows and lots of rare emotions and dangerous sensations but it bores easily and has no friendship in it, and often when it's over, it is as if a tornado passed. It's a very expensive form of recreation, a theatre play with daydreams, a frolic of your own in which you are the main event.  Human love is based in every day, not fantasies or illusions. It acknowledges the other person as a separate person and even loves them for their imperfections, for their vulnerabilities and their incompleteness, and allows them to change and to grow. It seeks to honour, not to use, to empower, not to overpower, and when it fails, it just gets cranky, it does not blow a fuse.
I like when your mind plays with mine. We harmonize like a dirty sweet symphony.
There isn't a more perfect person somewhere, only a more perfect person we might become, and there isn't a paradise someone can lead us to unless it's the world we make for ourselves when we stop expecting it to be delivered by someone else.
I loved him because the crazy in his heart only wanted me. He didn’t care what others thought. I was the one who aroused his senses and understood the turmoil of his mind.
I craved his hell to feel life again. He needed my tranquility to soothe his inner turmoil.
The smell of your lust like marmalade burning incense oranges and jasmine difficult to resist.
Why do you love me,” she asked. “Because you are the light and I am the moth. You can’t control your flame and I damn sure cannot control my attraction to it. You are going to rise for all your goodness and I will smolder in hell for causing you harm and breaking your heart,” he replied.
It's impossible to measure love, but that doesn't stop us coming up with new ways to try. One of the simplest is space: How much space am I prepared to give the person that you are so that you can become the person you want to become?
My childhood was hurtful enough but a church hurt leaves lasting detrimental wounds associated with a place of refuge.
There are no brakes in loving you. No life preservers. It is full throttle or nothing at all. I cannot stop, I won’t stop. I will drown in love and return dripping with madness and poetry. It is an art, a gift, this kind of lunacy.
I was told if I fell in love with a poet I would become immortal, so I decided to become the poet and make all those who touched my soul, eternal. I write friends and lovers into my stories, weaving them into fragments of sonnets and prose, the nectar of my poetry. My muses, perennial… Evergreen.
Ladies, your sensuality is the only key to not only attracting your ideal man but to also unlocking in him the best treasures no one has ever told you anything about.
Many a woman was killed by her man whom she stole from his ex.
It takes maturity to admit that you are wrong, especially when you are right.
She’s wild like whiskey and fierce like the sea. She belongs to no one, yet, she belongs willingly, so completely to me.
Are you ready to wander with me to take my hand to stumble, to dance to rocket to the moon? Are you ready to embrace the unknown and fly into ecstasy? Ready to get completely lost in love with me?
MODERN LOVE is so pathetic because of people's shallowness. Clearly people don't really care about understanding the actual deeper needs of others. The word 'longing' makes them cringe because they intrinsically know it's calling them into a DEEP PLACE OF CONNECTION. They'd rather open another bag of Dorridos, I tell you.
Drunk on imagination, that’s my kind of intoxication.
A well-fathered daughter will seek in her partnerships men who mirror the devoted father of childhood, avoiding partnerships that denigrate or compromise her. Having experienced the real thing when she was very young- having been taught self-reliance, she settles for no less when she is an adult.
Every time I pulled her back in only to disappoint her, I had unintentionally been solidifying what her mum had been telling her all these years. That she wasn’t enough, she wasn’t enough for me to take a chance on her or on us. I’d realised all too late that I was a coward, while she was petrified of never being enough for someone; she kept offering me a chance to prove her worries wrong. She was the strong one here.
I do not love only the women I desire, I only desire the women I love.
My desire since adolescence to have a personal relationship with Jesus was coming true, and my heart beat hard with excitement.
The reason I run a women's sensuality consultancy is because I want to help women groom themselves so they can get the very best out of their love life.
Millennials seek a mentoring sort of relationship as they are seeking to grow and learn. Use these opportunities to your advantage!
This is not a conventional “how-to” book. It contains no exercises, and it has few formulas saying “first do this, then do that.”   This is intentional. As we’ll see later, eros doesn’t like to be told what to do. If you set a goal, your sexual mind will be happy to reject it. It’s kind of childish and brilliant that way.  You also won’t find much about sexual biology or neurochemistry on these pages. Sex books these days tend to be full of advice for “boosting your dopamine”—or your oxytocin, or some other such nonsense. In all my 30 years as a sex therapist, I’ve yet to see a dopamine molecule walk into my office. We’ll stick with things you can see and feel yourself, without needing a laboratory.   I’ll also spare you the body diagrams. You already know what a penis and vagina look like, right? And we won’t discuss how many neurons are concentrated in your clitoris. It’s an impressive number, but who really cares?  There are a few great sex books already out there, and I’ll point them out to you as we go along. But reading most of the others is like gnawing on dry bones. As my friend and colleague Paul Joannides, the author of Guide to Getting it On (one of the aforementioned great ones), has accurately noted, “the trouble with most books on sex is they don’t get anyone hard or wet.”   This book is not intended to get you hard or wet. But it’s meant not to get in your way either. The chapters are short, so you can read them even if you get a little distracted. Hey, I hope you get a little distracted.   There are no lists to memorize, and there won’t be a test afterwards. We’re dealing with a part of the human mind that hasn’t gone to school yet, and never will.   Any questions?   OK, let’s get started . . .  Adapted from LOVE WORTH MAKING by Stephen Snyder, M.D. Copyright © 2018 by the author and reprinted with permission of St. Martin’s Press, LLC.

Drop the smirk Lawson, it's not getting you a ‘full entry' admission pass" ... "It's not huh, what about just a ‘general admission' ticket then?
Some men will sell a woman dreams...until she realizes that he will never close on that love transaction because a relationship is merely HER dream, heavily laden with good sex. In the getting to know you process, he figured out how to market her dream back to her in a beautifully wrapped empty box; topped off with a pretty bow.
So I think it is a reptile, though it may be architecture.
I am ready to abandon fear to tread the unknown path the uncertainty, the mystery the joy of discovering more of the world, internal riches more of you.
Each marriage experience unpleasant circumstances yet what is imperative is to take the important measures to spare your marriage before your relationship hit absolute bottom and ends up unrepairable. Overlooking the issues in your relationship and trusting that they will simply leave isn't helping your relationship. Get help from a marriage counselor before things in your marriage are destroyed.
You know, I've often wondered why I'd lose passion so quickly after declaring my undying love for my woman. And then it hit me, it's the FULL OWNERSHIP MENTALITY that spoils everything.
Now ladies, please get this: the moment you claim full ownership over your man (as in, he is NOW my man, 'My property!'), you not only lose your ability to overwhelm him with DESIRE, but you are also taking away his total freedom and smoothening rather than sharpening his EDGES to be his BEST loving and passionate self. To claim your man 'entirely' dampens his passion for you substantially.
Watch for signs of a toxic friendship and raise your guards: - Their criticism/comments make you feel small and embarrassed - They feel bitter on your achievements and try to minimise it in your and others' eyes - They don't feel/understand your situation and you find yourself explaining and justifying your actions - They are unhappy, complaining, dissatisfied and discontent with their life - They are self-centred and require a lot of attention without returning it when you are in need  - They are bully (sometimes subtle though) - They are not ready to take no as an answer  - They bear no criticism on themselves and are always right (it's always your fault) It's hard to let go of toxic people. It's easy to find a reason or an excuse for their behaviour. But remember, a real friend needs no explanations, justifications, modifications or adjustments. They accept you the way you are and are always there regardless, without ever judging you. The risk with this awareness is that you may find yourself walking alone with no real friend around you, but this is how I have discovered my one and only 100% real friend - God.
Being different is good insofar as it brings parts of ourselves that we didn't know they were there in the first place.
The real comfort is in seeing our kinsmen, no matter how we dislike them, but at least we're their belonging.
In some cases, when the groom is weak, uneducated than desired, unemployed or underpaid, the girls of normal class reject him. Then the groom's family has to search the bride beyond their region.
Always obey your self-respect. Your self-respect is just like an inner compass guiding you. Love your husband and family but never let them exploit you.
Fuck you and your First World problems! If every cunt that had taken their first ecky commited adultery by jacksie-rifling the first psycho fucker who smiled at them, not one worthwhile relationship in Britain would still exist!
Never let a man take up so much of your insides that he pushes YOU out. You shouldn't have to go looking for yourself when a relationship ends.
A soulmate is a romantic partner who really understands the needs of your soul, mind and body with little or no explanation needed.
But you are the only person I can show myself to. You always made my rough edges feel real.
the fallout after we ended is what demolished me.
My personal aim for love is not money, sex and/or a royal wedding, but it's having an ever-growing and ever-deepening connection with the one I choose to be with. Connection is so underrated in this day an age, and it's the most authentic thing ever, much like sensuality.

Honestly, the word "settling" makes my blood boil. It's an absolute insult! It introduces the degeneration of the soul and totally undermines our sensuality. It also dilutes the whole notion of what it means to be in love, in my opinion.
Please don't settle, it will only corrodes your soul and you will never be the best version of yourself.
In our hearts, when we choose to see people differently, they start to change. We participate in the healing of people.  We can choose to say, 'Somewhere in this person, there is a light, made in God's image.
V: You were everything to me, Stanley. Everything. S: You still love me? V: It's like a big stone in the road. S: And all those others? V: You know the way a bat bounces sounds off objects to find out where it is?
Don't ask how can I find a high quality man, rather ask how can I construct my life in such a high quality manner that high quality men just keep finding me.
Don't make your daughter feel like she got to lay with who you want her to lay with, like you're some kind of pimp.
Notice. Pray. Show up. Love.
True intimacy isn't a psychodrama. It isn't the "highest highs and lowest lows". It's communion and mellow compatibility. It's friendship and mutual respect.
Gerhard voelde dankbaarheid. Hij was dankbaar voor Jules bestaan, voor iedere minuut van haar aanwezigheid, voor ieder woord dat ze tot hem sprak. Hij had het gevoel dat hij geen recht op Jule had, en dat gevoel was, erkende ze al gauw, de enige fatsoenlijke basis voor een gelijkwaardige relatie tussen man en vrouw
As every reader has experienced who may have chanced to be in such a situation, it is extremely difficult to maintain the full dignity of an offended person, in the presence of a beautiful girl, whatever reason we may have for being angry with her.
To settle is to choose what is safe over what is highly necessary for your growth. Don't settle!
When indeed will we be mature enough to accept, for ourselves and our children, that there is no obligation to love, there is no guilt in not loving, and that the only valid basis for relationships...--between any human beings--is love freely given from both sides.
I fully realize that all men and women who are in love lie to themselves to one degree or another. Love, I’ve found, whitewashes its object. Any blemishes, crevices, or cracks are filled with pure and bright illusion, the root of which is vanity. Only over time does this brightness wear off.
Women don’t place as much value on what can be seen with the eyes as men do—it fades, you see, and the man who is an attractive fool at twenty becomes simply a fool by fifty.
Authentic people are usually very consistent.
As a women's sensuality catalyst, my primary goal is to help women who have lost their sense of femininity and confidence in finding a partner who really understands the needs of their soul, mind and body.
It is so important to cultivate a lifestyle that reflects the relationship you want to have with your ideal man. Set a standard for yourself that is true to who you are, the type of man you want to attract, and the lifestyle you want to have with him, then maintain it until it's deeply embedded in your DNA.
Any healthy relationship involves work, discipline, motivation, purpose, intent, and desire.
Self-discovery changes everything, including your relationships with people. When you find your authentic self, those who loved your mask are disappointed. You may end up alone, but you don’t need to stay alone. While it’s painful to sever old connections, it’s not a tragedy. It’s an opportunity. Now, you can find people who understand the importance of looking for truth and being authentic. Now, you can find people who want to connect deeply, like you’ve always wanted to, instead of constant small talk and head games. Now, you can have real intimacy. Now, you can find your tribe.
To an unhealed heart, true love is a scary thing to face.
When a guy calls you hot, he's looking at your body. When a guy calls you pretty, he's looking at your face. When a guy calls you beautiful, he's looking at your heart. All three guys still wanna fuck you though.
A truly sensual woman almost never gets heartbroken. Why? Because she doesn't attract heartbreakers in the first place, and not that the men she attracts are perfect, but I think the universe seems to value her a little bit too much.
Dear Valentine,  The solution to my odd problem is simplified to equal one person, you. You are always positive. With you, my semi-circle is complete. My feelings for you are always increasing, like the digits of Pi. It never ends. You fill the hole in the center of my heart. No distance can keep us apart.   Love,
Dear solitude, how I missed you in the times I was so attached to the illusion of loneliness, how I secretly longed for you in times of distraction with music and addiction, how I desired to dive into the creativity of your silent whispers.. oh solitude, I remember you there when I wrote my first book, I recall your inspiring voice when that pen hit the paper.. When I was no longer by your side, oh solitude, how you silently tried to draw me back to you, by showing me the continuous struggle to feel full among unfulfilling relationships or restless nights of loneliness.. Oh solitude, if it wasn't for you, where would I find all that you could provide, only you..
When I saw you I knew the universe had mastered my love language &amp; I'd go through any amount of anguish to be a student of its genius.
Every relationship is a love-lesson.
Maybe all relationships, friendship, partner, parent and child, were held together by the things you did not say as much as the things you did. The unsaid was the keystone in the arch. Once you kicked it free, you had nothing that held you up.
Trust this: the universe has got your back. No man can mess with you or take advantage of you for as long as you are fully in touch with your sensuality because there is something in you that every man was designed to reverence each time it is detected. You are a goddess. You command respect without even trying.
This morning, I woke up different. I accepted that life goes on... I might still love you, I might still miss you, but I'm better off without you. So, I'm closing this chapter of hurt because I deserve to be happy. And the only way I'll reach that is by letting go of toxic people who don't want to see me grow. Holding on doesn't make me strong, but letting go does.
I love him. These three words were echoing around inside her head, and the noise they were making was not diminishing. They were just three words, which separately were so non-threatening, so innocuous, but when combined in that order they implied so much.
Meghan Markle just single-handedly gave all divorced women more hope.
She: Why are you so HARD!  He: I am a Man! I can't help it!  She: Where will this take us?  He: On a journey where will discover something DEEP and EXCITING!
There is something incredible about the phrase "I'm sorry." When it's used carelessly, the expression is impotent, and can even offend. But when you really, really mean it--even if your mother is night-gowned and bed-ready with a scrum of toothpaste still in her mouth, when the words rise up inside of you on the strength of every way in which you've changed, it can be enough.
In order to have mutual love in a relationship, respect and appreciation for each other must also exist.
Within each of us is a beautiful gem. For some of us, that gem may stay hidden indefinitely. For others of us, with some personal work, that gem will get to see the light of day. All of us have the potential to unearth that inner beauty. The more we can work on ourselves, the smoother and more enjoyable our connections with others will be.
One thing was clear. I knew I wanted a relationship where there was no push-pull energy, the power struggles, the yanking back and forth. I wanted a relationship where the two energies, the two souls, simply danced, a beautiful dance… and loved.
Failure to sleep with someone is now an act of hostility, whereas it was once understood to be part of the natural process of searching for one’s mate.

The Circle of Friendships are those who help illuminate the darker sides of the road. They are the ones who will remain in the shadows with us in our greatest accomplishments, as well as our deepest fears.
Your sensuality has divine mandate to protect you.
Your sensuality has a divine mandate to protect you. Don't rob yourself of the ultimate experience of a lifetime.
Creating experiences and relationships that match your values and authentic desires, reinforce your essential worth and loveability.
A man, ladies, is not only attracted and retained by your sensuality or charm, he is also guarded (from cheating) and motivated (to succeed) by it too.
The essence of life is in solitude--wouldn't you agree? All unions are built on falsehood. People can only get to know each other up to a point and then they make up the rest, until one day, seeing their mistake, they turn their backs on sadness and run away. Would this ever happen if they stopped believing in their dreams and made do with what was possible?
In a world full of people, what could be more beautiful than knowing how to form healthy relationships and establish deeper connections with those around us.
When a man doesn't want you. He plays you. When a women doesn't want you. She humiliates you.
The good life is built with good relationships.
The two main girlfriends he has had wanted him to support them in the manner to which they certainly weren't accustomed even though he couldn't put his flabby hands on a penny.
Because honestly, to this day, I don't really know what made him interested in me. It's not that I hate myself, at least not most of the time - it's just that it wouldn't have been difficult for Jason to find a woman who was prettier, or more of a fighter for the underdog, or both. The one time I asked him about it, and I tried to ask as casually, as unpathetically, as possible, given that it's an inherently pathetic question, he said, "Because you had your act together." I think he was referring less to my career than to my not being anorexic or flat-out insane, in contrast to his previous girlfriends; one of them had literally weighed all her meals on a postage scale.
You thought it could wait, it was so alive you thought it could wait, that it took no effort because you could laugh, talk, go inside, find pure cream waiting for you. You turned into a dumb motherfucker and switched track, agreed to go work in Japan for six months, backed away as if every day this came your way, every day you could touch, play, connect, make dumb jokes, absurd gestures, feel the fuse between us, what are you calling me now for? I saw it way back, I saw it, I wanted it, waited around for you to see it, what are you calling me now for when i was right in the palm of your hand, damn it?
Sometimes the people you love the most are the most difficult for you to be around, because they see right through your crap and don’t mind telling you.
Often, when we have a crush, when we lust for a person, we see only a small percentage of who they really are. The rest we make up for ourselves. Rather than listen, or learn, we smother them in who we imagine them to be, what we desire for ourselves. We create little fantasies of people and let them grow in our hearts. And this is where the relationship fails.
Someone who wouldn’t be in a hurry to interfere with her world and what she wants to do. I think it’s better if two people don’t expect too much of each other. Live and let live.
But that was the nature of relationships: there always seemed to be an imbalance of one sort of another. And it was fine to plan an emotional strategy, but another thing when the ground opened up in front of you, and your defending troops toppled into a ravine which hadn't been marked on the map until a few seconds previously.
Relationships have an unfortunate way of wearing out, like most things in this world.
For Angelica, relationships were like the flower arrangement she was hiding behind. She plucked a white rose out of it and sniffed at it. Right now, they were beautiful. Perfect. Pristine with a shockingly beautiful scent. But in a day or two, they would be wilting, messily thrown in a waste bin.
Buying is the foundation of most women’s definition of romantic.

He turned to her and smiled. "OK. And you paint. Men come and go," he said, wagging a finger. "Be good to yourself. What you have? Inside? That's permanent. Any man doesn't see that, doesn't deserve you.
Requited love is not as likely as requited hatred.

We were blonde, but we weren't dumb.
90% of the girls are convinced that they were used and dumped by an exploitative sociopath.  Only 3% of men are sociopaths.  So at least 87% of you just don't know how to keep a man.
Because of their lack of originality, women who say that they like their men like they like their coffee turn off even men who are black and strong.
All these openings for closeness--all these humans with their disappointments and their desperate hearts, but it's so much easier, so convenient, to blame emotional distance on a lack of time.
Centuries telescoped into one evanescent moment. History was wrong-footed, caught off guard. Sloughed off like an old snakeskin. Its marks, its scars, its wounds from old wars and the walking backwards days all fell away. In its absence it left an aura, a palpable shimmering that was as plain to see as the water in a river or the sun in the sky. As plain to feel as the heat on a hot day, or the tug of a fish on a taut line. So obvious that no one noticed.
And that's why he's come back again, to tip these ashes onto the tongue of the wind and watch them spindrift into the night.  Not just to make the circle complete, to heal or mend but because he knows these walls,  sunk however low, still hold him in as well as out: protect as much as they defend.  -The Hill Fort
This world. This human race. It isn’t divided into sexes. Everybody thinks it’s divided into sexes but it isn’t. It’s the givers and the takers. The diners and the dinners.
I could barely conjure up comfortable, pleasant, free and easy feeling associated with a normal relationship.
COMMITMENT is like rain in Oregon. You wake up every morning and there it is. It cups your house in its liquid hands and fills your gutters to overflowing. It makes green things grow tall and lush, rivers run deep and invincible. On sunny days it seeps up through petals and pine needles, roots and aqueducts.   Other days, it makes mud too thick for walking, and you cannot leave the house. You pace the house, restless and lonely. Then you smell its perfume in a dry, empty room and part the curtains, watch it finger the window with long, slow rivulets.  From 'A Compendium of Miniatures
Watch out for dragons &amp; Betrayers! If one happens to find you, though, I beg you not to beat yourself up about it. Pull yourself out of whatever pit they leave you in and continue the journey -- for yourself. Life isn't always about serving others". ~ Betrayer; Fallenwood Chronicles Book 3 ~
The new idea of getting into a relationship because  You feel lonely Doesn't that feel kind of faulty?
You're going to lose him, Jane," Faith said. "I won't." "Yes," Faith said. "You will." "Okay, but I'll lose him my way," I say.
A great many people do believe that to be single is to be somehow incomplete and that they need to find the other half. [...] We believe, on the other hand, that the fundamental sexual unit is one person. Adding more people to that unit may be intimate, fun and companionable, but does not complete anybody.
The thing is, we can't be in right relationship to each other if we can't see each other. We can't be fully present in any relationship if we're walling off part of ourselves or hiding beneath a mask.
People with strong boundaries understand that it's unreasonable to expect two people to accommodate each other 100 percent and fulfill every need the other has. People with strong boundaries understand that they may hurt someone's feelings sometimes, but ultimately they can't determine how other people feel. People with strong boundaries understand that a healthy relationship is not about controlling one another's emotions, but rather about each partner supporting the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems.  It's not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about. It's about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That's unconditional love baby.
The problem with enemyfying is not that we never have enemies: we often face people and situations that present us with difficulties and dangers. Moreover, any effort we make to effect change in the world will create discomfort, resistance, and opposition. The real problem with enemyfying is that it distracts and unbalances us. We cannot avoid others whom we find challenging, so we need to focus simply on deciding, given these challenges, what we ourselves will do next.
There is a part of me that lives in a part of you, so we are never apart.
In my land, in the event of a divorce, the mother has the right to retain her children if they are still suckling. But in most cases, a mother maintains custody of daughters until a girl child reaches puberty. In the case of male children, the boy should be allowed to remain with his mother until he is seven. When he reaches his seventh birthday, he is supposed to have the option to choose between his mother or father. Generally it is accepted that the father have his sons at age seven. A son must go with his father at the age of puberty, regardless of the child's wishes. Often, in the case of male children, many fathers will not allow the mother to retain custody of a son, no matter what the age of the child.
I don’t hate men because they’re men, as nuns do. I dislike them because they’re not men enough: babies, and playboys, and poor things showing off all the time, even to themselves. I don’t say I’m any better. I only wish, with all my soul, that some men were bigger and stronger and deeper than I am...
No longer trusting someone is even more saddening if you still love them.
You must admit: it's not easy to live with people willing to send you to exile or death, it's not easy to become intimate with them, its not easy to love them.
Turning points in the evolution of a relationship are not always the result of dramatic events; they often stem from something that at first seems completely inconsequential.
Cal rolled his eyes. "It's simple. We're monogamous yet not committed non-platonic friends who are enjoying date-like activities together." I raised an eyebrow. "And you think that clarifies things?" "Well, I did. Until I said it again just now.
She's that bad boy you want, but in a girl who believes in recycling. Freud described the kinds of feelings I had for Amy as loving the same person twice, as a woman and as a man.
It's a cliche to tell someone "respect is earned." I guess you want me to sit there and continue to be disrespected until I 'earned' your respect. Never that. Respect is a mutual thing, don't care if you don't like me but you damn sure will respect me regardless or not...
The problem here is that most people who get caught cheating apologize and give the 'It will never happen again' spiel and that's that, as if penises fell into various orifices completely by accident. Many cheatees accept this response at face value, and don't question the values and fucks given by their partner (pun totally intended); they don't ask themselves whether those values and fucks make their partner a good person to stay with. They're so concerned with holding on to their relationship that they fail to recognize that it's become a black hole consuming their self respect.  If people cheat, it's because something other than the relationship is more important to them. It may be power over others. It may be validation through sex. It may be giving in to their own impulses. Whatever it is, it's clear that the cheater's values are not aligned in a way to support a healthy relationship. And if the cheater doesn't admit this or come to terms with it, if he just gives the old 'I don't know what I was thinking; I was stressed out and drunk and she was there' response, then he lacks the serious self-awareness necessary to solve any relationship problems.
My little weaver was tough, and he'd survive without me, but I didn't want to survive without him.
What does an equal partnership look like? One significant study showed that when partners see that they can influence the other person, they both have the experience of being heard and recognized. This mutual influence fosters open communication and the greater likelihood of sharing feelings, needs, and vulnerabilities. As a result, better intimacy is created in which both partners benefit and feel satisfied with the relationship (Steil 1997).   However, as Gottman recognized in his long-term research on marriage, husbands were far less willing to be influenced and often stonewalled or distanced themselves verbally and emotionally from conversations (Gottman and Silver 2000). He also determined in his studies that 81% who are not willing to be influenced by their partner are at risk for divorce. That women seem more interested in a balanced relationship between partners might account for the findings that more women instigate divorce (Coontz 2005).
Dating Sekhmet is like trying to romance an inferno, to clasp a creature of ancient aggression so close you either smothered its flames of carnage or were consumed by them. Either way, it's all or nothing, a conflict at turns brutal and brilliant, subtle and shocking. As real as any war, theirs is a relationship with its own particular feints, charges, tactics, and stratagems, each deployed in the hope of winning another inch of territory in the other's heart.
Well, we are human. Indeed, we make mistakes. We’ll make so many of them that we’ll lose count. Stop keeping count. Stop keeping score. Stop holding grudges.
You may find that yes, your partner tends to shout easily, but the shouting contains no malice and passes quickly. Perhaps your partner's short fuse does not prevent them from being loving and supportive. In that case, you may have found a gem whom others have avoided because they cannot get past the bursts of temper. But if you find that time after time, a partner or close friend disappoints you by being just like a difficult parent, then you would do well to consider whether you are selecting someone who helps you reproduce that difficult relationship.
a single outburst does not produce a difficult relational environment. It is only when a parent [or anyone] repeatedly and regularly uses anger to close conversations, in the broadest sense of 'conversation,' that a dilemma is framed. When a parent [or partner] uses anger or the threat of anger to dominate the emotional atmosphere, then even potentially good conversations with them lose spontaneity, openness and honesty.
To Maintain Your Relevance In Relationships, Don't Run Into Them Because of What You Need, Get Into Them Because of What You Have To Offer....
Their walking relationship was unnatural, but they were too fearful to seat themselves at a restuarant to share a meal, for they knew that restaurants in our country are the principal target of the active and increasingly familiar morals committees that harass people of every nationality who live in Saudi Arabia. Such committees are composed of menancing men who unexpectedly surround and enter eating establishments, demanding identification of the restaurant patrons. If proof is not forthcoming that the men and women sharing a table are not husband and wife, brother or sister, or father and daughter, these frightened people will be arrested and escorted to a city gaol, with punishment freely given. The legal penalties vary according to the nationality of the 'criminal'. Muslim offenders can be flogged for their social misconduct, while non-Muslims are gaoled or deported.
Age is irrelevant when it comes to adult male/female relationships, it is all about power levels
Parla abbastanza a lungo con qualcuno e tirerà fuori la storia del tempo.  Ma il tempo non guarisce veramente le ferite, non allontana affatto il dolore - fa il contrario. Il tempo dà altro tempo alla ferita d'infettarsi e dà a noi il tempo di tornare sui luoghi di quel dolore. È come l'infanzia, in fondo. Si dice che si cresce, ci si lasciano alle spalle certe cose, ma non è così: l'infanzia cresce insieme a noi, ce la portiamo avanti. Viviamo e non facciamo altro che rivivere quelle paure e quei piaceri, quelle scoperte e quegli abbandoni. Specialmente quegli abbandoni. Veniamo abbandonati, delusi, traditi dalle stesse persone per anni - per sempre.  Allora a che serve dire che è passato del tempo? In che modo dovrebbe aiutarci?
The story is what connects us. My story. Your story. Our story.
Sometimes, we become so preoccupied with our own trials that we unwittingly reduce other people to the other. The other we interact with, come to enjoy the company of, perhaps even love, but the other nonetheless. We forget that they're people, too.

Generally, people like people who are like themselves.
As we become more open and accepting of others and appreciative of what they have to offer, they open up more to us in return.
This is what it would be like, I realized. We could come home to each other every night.  It didn't have to be all blood and gore and fancy dinners. It could also be this, and this felt so good.
We all like to think we’re open-minded and objective when it comes to evaluating situations and people. But are we? A huge body of research in physics, biochemistry, and psychology says we’re not.
The practices and disciplines of building and sustaining community could fill volumes (and has). From mystics to anthropologists, we learn how critical the quality of a community is to the health and well-being of people. Yet, community remains one of the most elusive goals to so many of the Christians and churches in our individualistic Western societies. When we encounter true community, we are not encountering mere healthy relationships of equality and moral uprightness, but we are witnessing, and being invited to participate in, the divine nature of God.

THE FLOWER OF LOVE  Love means to be willing to sacrifice oneself for another.   Hate means the desire to destroy the other.   In the world, there is an abundance of hate and no flower of love.   Hatred come to an end when a person begins to see himself in all living beings, and begins to see all living beings – the whole existence, the stones, the trees, the animals and the human beings - in himself.   It is to see the divine, Brahman, God, in the whole existence.   There is no other obstruction in the way of love except hate.   Without hate, love will bloom.   Love is our nature.   Love is the nature of life.   Love is not born, it does not die.   Love is eternal.
The situation improved once it occurred to them that they should also talk; as they came to understand each other they learned that what they'd been afraid of was running out of self. On the contrary the more they loved the more there was to love

It was an intense embrace, no awkwardness, no holding back, the kind of hug two people can only achieve after long intimacy, but anyone can give in an instant to a stuffed bear.
Post-script: When my tutor got a famous scholarship and went to Oxford, he broke my heart, of course. I sobbed in cafés and hotel bars, bored my friends half to death, and thought myself tragically bereft. I cannot in all honesty claim to have been liberated from anything in particular by my relationship with this man. I hated his subject and was bad at it, failed it twice and did not care. He made me laugh, that's the main thing I remember. I often felt he was privately laughing at me, from the eminence of his twenty-four years. This made me watchful and defensive....it had never occurred to me to call what happened between me and my tutor 'sexual harassment' or 'abuse of power'.
An alpha man is confident, fully centered in his masculine core, sure of his self worth and what he brings to the table in dating and relationships. He doesn't seek the approval of others and is repulsed by women who don't recognize his value, no matter how attractive the woman might be. An alpha man knows that he fully deserves a partner who mutually chooses him and makes a mutual effort to be together. If a man doesn't recognize himself to be valuable, then women will not see him as valuable either. What you feel, you attract." (Coach Ricioppo Parra)
One ends a romantic relationship while remaining a compassionate friend by being kind above all else. By explaining one’s decision to leave the relationship with love and respect and emotional transparency. By being honest without being brutal. By expressing gratitude for what was given. By taking responsibility for mistakes and attempting to make amends. By acknowledging that one’s decision has caused another human being to suffer. By suffering because of that. By having the guts to stand by one’s partner even while one is leaving. By talking it all the way through and by listening. By honoring what once was. By bearing witness to the undoing and salvaging what one can. By being a friend, even if an actual friendship is impossible. By having good manners. By considering how one might feel if the tables were turned. By going out of one’s way to minimize hurt and humiliation. By trusting that the most compassionate thing of all is to release those we don’t love hard enough or true enough or big enough or right. By believing we are all worthy of hard, true, big, right love. By remembering while letting go.
To a degree that we seldom realize, we depend upon the participation of others in our lives, and upon our own participation in the lives of others. Our success and effectiveness as persons is based upon this participation, and upon an ability to maintain a controlling competence in communicating with others.
You can hardly say of your soul what sex it is. But if you pay close attention, you will see that the most masculine man has a feminine soul, and the most feminine woman a masculine soul.
One doesn't simply grieve the loss of a relationship. One grieves the loss of the possible future, as well as the wiping-out of the past.
It has been my experience that one cannot, in any shape or form, depend on human relations for any lasting reward. It is only work that truly satisfies.
How necessary Sundays have become. I reach for them like sleeping lovers on the other side of my earth or my mattress.
Our family of origin—the source of our first blueprint for navigating relationships.
If i could be the best on one thing,  I wish that would be  "RELATIONSHIP"  with God, with my Family, with my Love ones, with all my Friends,  and with All living things.  In which, most of us fails.
Do not expect from others what you cannot offer yourself.” —Sepideh Irvani, PsyD
The moon &amp; sun were just friends til that night the sun couldn’t depart before dark snowed in under an avalanche of stars &amp; poetry was born.
I did not attend any Academy so it is not my job to police you or try to catch you in any act. If I get to the point where I feel the need to do that, I'd rather just walk away cuz it means you've lost my trust and without that, we have nothing left. Our foundation is cracked and I'm not living in a shaky house.
You kept me down so you would feel up, but love isn't a competition. The sun and the moon exist simultaneously in their aloneness, bestowing light, guiding life and time, because they work together. I'm not sure if I'm the sun or if I'm the moon, but I have found a love that embraces the equality of their inseparable connection.
Je zit er nog middenin. Je zult er altijd middenin blijven zitten. Nee, niet letterlijk. Maar in je hart. Niets houdt ooit op, niet als het zo diep is gaan zitten. Je zult altijd met een open wond blijven rondlopen. Dat is na verloop van tijd nog de enige keus. Met een open wond rondlopen of dood. Denk je ook niet?
It's not that other people seduce us. It's that we so desperately crave the destruction of our own lives.
Every single man is boring in a long-time relationship. But it's OK because the journey by man is charm-full.
You've been a really good friend to me, Richard. And I've sort of got to quite like having you around. Please don't go.' He squeezed her hand in his gently. 'Well,' he said, 'I've sort of got to quite like having you around, too. But I don't belong in this world. In my London...well, the most dangerous thing you ever have to watch out for is a taxi in a bit of a hurry. I like you too. I like you an awful lot. But I have to go home.' She looked up at him with her odd-coloured eyes, green and blue and flame. 'Then we won't ever see each other again,' she said. 'I suppose we won't' 'Thanks for everything you did,' she said, seriously. Then she threw her arms around him, and she squeezed him tightly enough that the bruises on his ribs hurt, and he hugged her back, just as tightly, making all his bruises complain violently, and he simply didn't care.
Dingen die eenmaal weg zijn, kunnen niet teruggehaald worden, dat wist hij nu wel. Een klap, eenmaal uitgedeeld, kan niet worden ingetrokken. Woorden, eenmaal uitgesproken, kunnen niet onuitgesproken worden gemaakt. We mogen verdergaan alsof er niets verloren, niets gedaan, niets gezegd is, we mogen beweren het allemaal te vergeten, maar ons diepste wezen vergeet niet, omdat we voor altijd veranderd zijn.
I wouldn't consider myself a control freak, but I've had my moments. I've seen trouble coming and fought, fumed, and frazzled myself trying to control circumstances and situations. One of the most impossible things to control is something walking around on two legs called a human being. I've manipulated and thrown temper tantrums trying to get another person to behave the way that seemed best to me. After all, doesn't someone need to control the bad behaviors of others? But after fifty-one years of life on this planet, including thirty years of marriage, I've concluded that the only thing I can control is my attitude. Everything else is fantasy. I've tried to control my kids. I've tried to control my churches. I've tried to control my dog, Gavin. I've even tried to control Tina (not a good idea). A sure sign of when I'm trying to control things, people, or circumstances is that I get frustrated, develop a bad attitude, and usually end up angry.
If a woman tells you how to make love to her, believe her.
In a relationship always try to create your own space and not aim to replace.
pride only gurantees you will LOSE - whether now or eventually - what it will be that you lose or who it will be - only time will tell ... - (G Swiss)
Earning the ability to shamelessly have the freedom to love and have sex with who you want and honor your desires is an inspiration.
It felt so huge, so significant, to share such an awful part of myself with him - to be so unbalanced, and to know that I could trust him to be my counterweight.
Women spend all their lives looking for a Hero. But sadly enough, there isn't a Jesus for every Magdalena.
I wish I could also understand  Why relationships sour  Why friends turn hostile  Why emotions die  Why efforts to save them prove futile?
A good wife isn't supposed to argue with her husband. My mother says you wait until he goes out, or he's asleep, and then you do what you want.
That said, what we can learn in the chapters ahead is enormous. We can maximize the chance of being heard and moving relationships forward. We can take a conversation to the next level when the initial foray doesn’t bring the desired result. We can stop nonproductive conversational habits so that an old relationship will take a new turn. We can clarify what we feel entitled to and responsible for—and what we really want to say. Or, alternatively, we can learn to sit more comfortable with our confusion. We can operate from a solid position of self, even when the other person won’t speak to us at all.
Family means true happiness. Stay loyal to your true happiness.
As soon as my friends and I start dating for real, we enter an exhausting paradox – a belief that, in love, everything is not as it seems: the conviction that there is a common state of affairs whereby a man can be madly in love with you and wish to spend the rest of his life with you, but will indicate this in a variety of ways so subtle, only the truly talented and determined will discern his true desires. Like it’s The Da Vinci Code, and when a man takes you out to dinner, gets off with you, then doesn’t call for two weeks, there’s a secret challenge he’s setting you that – with enough algebra, consultation of ancient scrolls, and wailing on the phone to your female friends – you can decode and, eventually, get married, i.e., win… .You can always tell when a woman is with the wrong man, because she has so much to say about the fact that nothing’s happening.  When women find the right person, on the other hand, they just… disappear for six months, and then resurface, eyes shiny, and usually about six pounds heavier.  “So what’s he like?” you will say, waiting for the usual cloudburst of things he says and things he does and requests of analysis of what you think it means that his favorite film is Star Wars (“Trapped in adolescence – or in touch with his inner child?”).  But she will be oddly quiet.  “It’s just… good,” she will say. “I’m really happy.
Who knew such belongings? That the truest love Could blend The margins of life Into forgotten wants.
But, sometimes, especially late at night, when only the wind is awake with my thoughts, I feel an urgent need. I think of lacing up my tennis shoes and stepping out the door, already in a half run. I think of running and running forever, until I become part of the night sky. -The Art of Leaving
My dad loves marriage rites. Any sort of family magic, actually. He and my mother are bound together in five dimensions.’ ‘That’s lovely,’ Baz says, and I’m terrified because I think he means it.
It was in those moments that I became one of them, one of the leavers. I'm leaving and I'm never coming back, I thought. It felt powerful. I finally felt in control. Is this how it felt to all the others. the leavers, the takers, the breakers? I became what they were. I could disappear. -The Art of Leaving
He would smile his angel smile, and I would feel at once our togetherness and our deep separation. -The Art of Leaving
What was sad was knowing she was most likely the last reminder that there might never be <i>another go</i>. We might still communicate, might still meet for coffee, but the dream was gone, the hand across the table was gone, the square itself was gone.
The danger of tolerating any hurtful behavior is that it can all too quickly become the norm. If we allow ourselves to "get away" with anything we know to be destructive - such as slapping a child or partner in the face - without taking responsibility for the gravity of what we have done, we are that much more likely to minimize the offense: "I may have overreacted, but she's got to learn not to set me off like that." . . . "because the partner is perceived as the cause of the violence, the perpetrator feels justified in using it." Once the actions are justified, they are more likely to be repeated.  It is also important to remember that, in most relationships, both parties engage in some form of the abuses listed above. Angry remarks or mildly aggressive actions - insulting someone's intelligence, throwing a plate of food against the wall - can both provoke and be used to justify retaliatory actions that may be more dangerous, like pushing and shoving someone down the stairs.  On the other hand, one sort of abuse does not necessarily lead to another. Rather, whether or not the violence escalates depends on the person committing it.
Impermanence. It is the nature of all things, especially relationships. They are certainly not a true cause of happiness.
Praise God for people who step with us, not on us
You know, the dreams you had for me weren't my dreams," he said. "Maybe those dreamsare meant for you.
He repeated that she had to learn to be alone. Once she’d learned that, then she would know how to live with a man without clamouring and demanding and suffering disappointments.
A healthy relationship isn't about completing each other. You are already complete. It is about encouraging each other to show up as your best self.
You deserve to be the love of someone's life, not the one who followed that first act.
I have a memory-flash of something Dawn said in a family-therapy session, right before my dad spilt–He's calm but wrong, and I'm loud but right, but since he's calm, it always seems like he's right.
Relationships is all about learning to see through the lens of another.
Love knows no grave. Real love can rise from the ashes.
Run your fingers across my skin, slowly. Tear down my layers. I want to feel you within. Life is unpredictable. I have been afraid. I have been sad. I have been disappointed. But I don’t want to live behind walls of safety, because I have been hurt. I want to feel your skin against mine and your fingers wandering across me. I want our lives to intertwine dangerously, our essences naked and colliding in reckless passion. I don’t want to exist trapped behind a wall, observing life as an outsider from a window seat. I want you to strip me down layer by layer and hold me from the inside out.
Of course it's not your fault." She smoothed Hazel's hair. "Don't ever blame yourself for someone else's choices.
I think there was no time but now when we were supposed to know each other. One thing ends and another begins.
She loved the heat of his stomach against hers, of his arms around her, of her hands on his neck and face. In that moment, she understood how easy it could be to open up and love someone.
She felt calm and tingly and warm. She wanted connection: to be understood, chosen, loved, seen, noticed, and known. It felt as though touch could heal her, could make her whole again.
Couples counseling has long been banned from the list of acceptable treatments for domestic violence . . . "an inappropriate intervention that further endangers the woman." Schechter explained:  'It encourages the abuser to blame the victim by examining her "role" in his problem. By seeing the couple together, the therapist erroneously suggests that the partner, too, is responsible for the abuser's behavior. Many women have been beaten brutally following couples counseling sessions in which they disclosed violence or coercion. The abuser alone must take responsibility for the assaults and understand that family reunification is not his treatment goal; the goal is to stop the violence.
I was so scared of losing you, living my life without you but  You left!
The human desire to connect and the tendency to disconnect from others out of fear of getting hurt are paradoxical. Paradoxically, people yearn for love and connection with others yet irrationally fear love and pain, whether it is love of self or others.” — Sepideh Irvani, Psy.D.. from AUTHENTIC SELF-LOVE (2017)
Afterward, she would finally come to understand what it meant to be human, what it felt like when the wrong man loves a woman, how the touch of a hand on her back--placed at the exact spot where the shoulder blades end and before the spine begins--can feel like the way that wings beat in the darkest part of the night.
Do not expect from others what you cannot offer yourself.” —Sepideh Irvani, PsyD
Love isn’t just doing what’s right for you but acting selflessly for the benefit of everyone else’s equality.
One has many more supposed friends when one is up than when one is down, because most people like to be with winners than shun losers. True friends are the opposite.
I have a memory-flash of something Dawn said in a family-therapy session, right before my dad spilt – <i>He's calm but wrong, and I'm loud but right, but since he's calm, it always seems like he's right.</i>
For business and personal relationships to flourish, we must engage with the people in our lives. Together is better. Together is how we win.
Words are powerful, but truly strong relationships are not shaken by the spoken words, for the words in the heart are heard loud and clear, despite the temperamental poor choice of the word uttered.
People don’t cry because they’re weak. They cry because they’ve been strong for too long.
When we lose someone we love, we can either die with them or live on to celebrate their life. I’m tired of focusing on what we lost. I want to focus on what we had.
Just when you thought you’d reached a good place in life, a crisis could erupt and spill into the corners you thought most secure.
A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge.
Taking responsibility is a step toward redemption.
Right or not, a mother always blamed herself when something went wrong.
Which is more abiding – a mother’s love or a child’s need for it?
Sarcasm is the language of the devil.
Searching for self implied either not liking who you are or wanting to escape who you’ve been.
People don’t get what they deserve; they get what they work for.
Confidence could be applied like makeup. I knew that for fact.
It was too early in the day for this kind of discussion – but really, was it ever too early to discuss matters of the heart? What if the moment passed and never returned?
We were not of this world— Dancing with fireflies we lit up the night sky embracing the darkness and light within each other. We tasted of salt and earth and flesh. He dissolved in me,  while I melted with him. Together, he and I became intensity, perfect insanity. Ethereal, eternal, omnipotent, limitless— We loved beyond this world.
Not until I felt your sunshine, Did I realize that I had been in the shade. Not until I saw all your colors, Did I realize that mine had faded. Not until I heard your dreams, Did I realize that I was still sleeping. And not until I experienced my life with you, Did I realize that I was barely Breathing.   NOT UNTIL I MET YOU by Suzy Kassem
He unlocked the gate to the darkest part of his soul, the part hidden from the world, and welcomed me to his entire Kingdom. He released the bolt lifting the steel chamber that protected my heart for so long, because with him hiding was no longer necessary, guarding was pointless....I was free.....to be me, entirely and truly to the darkest fiercest root, to the brightest beam of light....to become the queen of his throne, the ruler of his joy. We loved beyond comprehension, in the light and the dark, under blue and purple moons and rain-bows of fire. We were the mates to our souls. He was my King, I his Queen, in his Wonderland where he took me, kissed me and loved me, all of me, every day, tire-lessly,  relentlessly, protecting me, reassuring me I was his heart, and he was mine. I was Kingdom. He was my Throne. With vows until the end of time.
They say mountains don't really move  when you fall in love. I don't believe them, because I swear I saw mountains move the moment I fell in love with you. And I swear I feel the ground shake  every single time we touch. And when we kiss,  hot liquid stars tumble from the sky, searing my skin. Don't tell me there is no such thing as magic. Our love has proven them wrong.
He doesn't love me in an ordinary fashion,  with flower petals and saccharine words.  He loves me sublimely,  dirty words and filthy thoughts.  He fists my hair and pushes me down. He grabs my face, he tastes my lips,  devouring me with venom kisses and vampire bites. That's how he loves me; Recklessly, yet lovingly,  down to the depths and desperateness  of my lonely bones.  He understands me: my needs, my hungers, my cravings, desires. He is the only one who has ever gotten to my core,  my soul! He completes me,  makes me holy. Cinder and crimson unite, infinite combustion.
A bizarre sensation pervades a relationship of pretense. No truth seems true. A simple morning's greeting and response appear loaded with innuendo and fraught with implications.
The demons, they return to haunt the crimp in my heart. No amount of burning herbs, or magic spells and bitter potions cast the beasts away. Garlic rosaries won't  remove the black infection slowly devouring within.  Only love, perfect love, casts out the monsters and the fiends that invade like a thief in the night infecting and destroying, attempting to steal my joy. But love is life and I choose life. I choose love. Throw away the herbs, release the spells, let me swallow love's divinity.
The best time of a relationship is when your eyes speak when silence says everything  Expressions are the beak
It takes two, and each couple’s bonding experience is different, just like falling in love is different for each couple. What it comes down to acceptance of whatever that common ground you share is that makes your bonding one that will last
THE RIVER OF A WOMAN  Man is like a desert without the rain of a woman. Nothing can be born and grown without her nourishment. She is a life-giving river that gives and loves without holding anything back. And without her water, man would walk around aimlessly, feeling incomplete and hollow like an empty well. The longer he roams, the deeper the hole within his soul expands, growing bigger and bigger like a barren tree whose branches resemble the cracks on hard, dry soil. And he shall continue to feel incomplete and malnourished, until – he encounters a godly woman, to show him life and quench his thirst.
You can't fix a bad man like a bad staircase.
I don't know. I don't know shit about love. And even though I'm gay, I don't know shit about being gay.
If you neglect your fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, husbands, and wives, then don't be surprised when the Creator is forced to neglect you. Neglect, and you will be neglected. Protect, and you will be protected. Reject, and you will be rejected. Love all, and all that love will be mirrored by the Creator and reflected back onto YOU.
How a person treats their parents is how they show their gratefulness to the Creator for life. How a husband and wife treat each other, is how they show the Creator how well they do with this gift of life, and how they value LOVE. And what each parent must teach their kids, are the valuable lessons they gained in life. A father must be good to his wife and daughter, because from watching this treatment -- the son will learn how to treat all women, and his daughter will know what a good man is supposed to act like. And a mother must always remain morally good and faithful to her husband, be attentive to all her children, and be filled with patience, forgiveness, kind words, compassion and love -- so her children are raised to respect all mothers, and know what a good woman is supposed to act like.

Protect, and you will be protected. Reject, and you will be rejected. Love all, and all that love will be mirrored by the Creator...and reflected back onto YOU.
Our world needs more white flags – in relationships, friendships, political agendas and education – because we are now endorsed with countless capacities to spot red flags but too often we forget about reconciliation.
Some people get married because of what they hope to receive, rather than what they want to give. This is a recipe for disaster.
There are three people you will be judged heavily on how you treat them in this lifetime. For the man, it is his mother for giving him life, his wife for showing him life, and his daughter for teaching her all that he learned from life. For the woman, it her father for giving her the seed of life, her husband for showing her life, and her son for teaching him all that he has learned from life. How a person treats their parents is how they show their gratefulness to the Creator for life. How a husband and wife treat each other, is how they show the Creator how well they do with this gift of life, and how they value LOVE.

There are always hurdles in life. Getting over them is how we move forward.
When you lose the most precious thing in your life, how do you go on? How do you not?
Anger was what came of hurt that had simmered too long.
The trouble with waking up in the morning is that you look like who you are. That’s great if you like who you are – not so great if you don’t.
Men weren’t always a solution. There were times when they made things worse.
What if the past won’t stay packed away in a box with my name on it, just sitting there until I feel like taking if off the shelf and lifting the lid?
Silence had pounded a nail in the coffin of my marriage. But communication was key.
Hope is the future lined in gold, my mother used to say, but I didn’t agree. Hope wasn’t the future. It was only a vehicle to get there.
Confrontation was a great idea – unless the odds were so stacked against you that it was pointless.
Parents can be narrow-minded when it comes to the dreams they have for their kids.
If you no longer have a child, are you still a mother?
You drink your whiskey, I’ll drink my wine. Later when we’re fevered and tipsy we’ll make savage love divine. Until then, let’s swim in the warm, opal sea of each other. Crash a few innocent waves, skinny dip, laugh and get lost in those blood-pumping hearts, and for a time forget all our broken parts.
It wasn’t her hypnotic eyes that drew him in  or the wild sway of her hips; it was that devil’s blood-red lipstick  smeared all over her chubby angel lips.  He shivered with the magnitude  of impending heaven and hell in one woman.  He crashed into heaven  while crossing the thresholds of hell.
Take her on a date to a book store—So she may get a better idea of who you are…to see your expressions while perusing the classics, poetry, erotica. She needs to see how you react to books she adores. Will your eyes light up when she asks you to read to her some more? She wants to experience how you taste your words. She wants to know if you get lost in different worlds and if you find magic when you gaze into a book. For her, this will be the initial hook.
You will find all the riches you ever need in the center of your heart.  Go there. Explore.
I am simply a complicated girl  Mesmerized by mystery Enchanted with shadows Intrigued by glitter and gray in each of us A girl fascinated with word-play; Paradoxes, ironies, conundrums In love with adventure and curious about the world A girl who feels and dreams deeply Loves passionately  Lives recklessly But about all else, I am a girl insanely in love with you! You are my greatest inspiration!
I wanted to punch something. Wanted to scream. Wanted to run away. Instead, I went to my center, my heart,  where I purged my raging emotions.  I pleaded for answers, when suddenly a gentle calm washed over me Love wrapping limbs around me, I found an inner peace.  Serenity. All within.
He gave me wild kisses and left me with ashes. The taste of him  still scorches my mouth, my lips, my tongue.
Her intensity drove me over the edge. Her eyes, burning crazy like an inferno, brought out the madman in me. She was danger and I wanted in.
She was the night,  in love with the stars,  always chasing the moon.  He was an early cup of coffee, in love with her wild ocean breeze,  her mischievous ways,  her childish play.
She saw the monster in him but she stayed anyway. Thinking…rationalizing…praying…if she could love those hideous parts, so cleverly hidden from the  masses, the cold-blooded beast, the frigid demonic-like heart, the ice would thaw and underneath there might be warmth and light. But a monster is a monster, no matter how many angels cross his path. You can dress them, disguise their beastly horns, but at the end of the day, with masks stripped away, they remain what they’ve always been and always will be – heartless. Ru-in and destruction is the only way they play. Demons won’t be kept at bay.
It’s easy to un-love the devil; Remind yourself all he ever was, all he will ever be. A Jekyll. A Poison. Heart the color of the blackest night. A tongue full of wicked lies and tasteless deception. Teeth ready to tear into his next victim’s heart.
At this moment, we are one and the same - one soul inhabiting two bodies.
The blade of loving you  is what will kill me in the end.
Purging you from my heart  is like a junkie in detox: utterly painful. You are rooted in my marrow, flowing in my veins. You are the topography of my soul.
Without you, I am unhinged Your voluptuous mind is red velvet to my soul Your tender touch, your prodding tongue Igniting the woman beast in me Our primal urges and animal instincts Our connection like electricity I need you like a book needs a spine As a butterfly needs wings to fly I crave you like the moon craves the night Every cell in my body aches without you Oh, what sweet agony!
He loved her like a roaring lion, even when she was most unlovable, and there’s a lot to be said for that… that kind of fierce, raging, omnipotent love.
He loved me until my bones bled, then he loved some more. He loved me in the depths of hell; He loved me there first, before anywhere else and I've never felt a love, a force, as powerful, as complete.
He told me I had too many books, how would I ever read them all! I looked at him for the monkey lunatic I suddenly realized he was, and politely told him it was time for him to go…back to whatever jungle from which he came. How foolish of me to let him into my intellec-tual sanctuary. A girl like me, who lives for adventure, mindgasms, fairytales and soul stimulation have too many books? Read too much poetry? Pffff!
Do yourself a huge favor. Do not allow people to sabotage your spirit or water down your internal fire just because they are filled with fears and insecurities. If people are incapable of being soul lifters, then you need to reevaluate  your relationship with them. Perhaps those individuals aren’t meant  to be a part of your life. Some don’t know better; they are small, weak and full of fear. Their desire is to drag you to their low level. Don’t allow it. Do not permit thoughts of little people  to poison your spirit. Don’t stoop. Free yourself of negative energy vampires. Wish them well and move on.
A habit that forms from this is that I can ask Eric questions when he is asleep.  Once I hear the first snore, I say, Why is your trajectory so straight? Why is your family so nice? It seems unfair how easy everything comes to you. In your last life you must have been a dung beetle. Or someone who gave up his life for someone else. Perhaps a pregnant woman crossing the street.  Do you remember?  Then I part his autumn hair and bring my voice down to a whisper. Please stop, just for a little while, and let me catch up. How do you expect me to marry you if you never let me catch up?
If you abandon yourself in order to be in a relationship, you cannot be in a relationship
The flavour of that first kiss disappointed me, like fruit you taste for the first time. It's not in new things that we experience the greatest pleasure, but in habit.
Some relationships be like: You never talk, but you always stalk.
Getting a man to love you is easy Only be honest about your wants as Woman. Stand nude before the glass with him So that he sees himself the stronger one And believes it so, and you so much more Softer, younger, lovelier. Admit your Admiration.  Gift him all, Gift him what makes you woman, the scent of Long hair, the musk of sweat between the breasts, The warm shock of menstrual blood, and all your Endless female hungers. Oh yes, getting A man to love is easy, but living Without him afterwards may have to be Faced.
Maybe it’s better to be with someone you don’t love too much. Someone you love just enough, but not so much that it could destroy you.
Back in bed I listen to every sound. The plastic tarp over the table on the balcony crunching in the cold wind. the two short clicks in the walls before the heat comes on with a low whoosh. I hear a constant base hum all around, the nervous system of the building, carrying electricity and gas and phone conversations to all our respective little boxes. I listen to it all, the constant, the rhythmic, and the random. It's hard to measure the night by sound, but it can be done. I know that when the traffic noise is quietest, it's about 4:30 in the morning. I know that when the 'Times' hits the door, it's around 5. Now the clock says it's morning, 5:45, but the November sky still says midnight. I hear the elevator ding twenty yards down the hall outside our door. Seven seconds later, I hear his keys in our lock, then his heavy backpack hitting the floor. I hear the refrigerator door open, the unsealing vacuum wheezing as the cold inside air meets the dry heat in the apartment. The cupboard door. A glass. The crescendoing fizz of a new two-liter Diet Coke bottle opening. It's a one-sided conversation with no one actually talking. I lie in the dark, close my eyes, and try not to listen to his movements around apartment. these are the sounds of our life together before it got so messy. I want to say something back. Anything, anything that sounds like things sounded last summer. Even just to myself. Just something out loud.  The inside of my eyelids turn pink. My door has been opened and the light from the hallway shines through them. I won't open them. There is no noise.  Like an eclipse, the world behind my closed eyes goes dark again. For just one second, before I feel a kiss on my right eye. I keep them closed. A kiss on the left one. I open them. Jack looks down at me and closes his eyes. He leans forward and puts his forehead on my chest and goes limp. ''Blues Clues' is on,' he says softly into my tee shirt. His muffled voice vibrating only a half inch away from my heart.
I've been able to classify most of their responses into ten emotional needs—admiration, affection, conversation, domestic support, family commitment, financial support, honesty and openness, physical attractiveness, recreational companionship, and sexual fulfillment.
We love some people so much that we offer them the chance to destroy us time and time until they finally do." From He wrote Lily.
She used to test his commitment by hurting him. She threatened to leave him, or cheat on him, then watched his face and measured the depth of his feelings for her by the extent to which it crumbled. He was insecure; prone to worry. If he ever became confident, she thought, it would mean that he no longer loved her, since to love someone is to worry; to need someone is to fear the inevitability of their absence. Without fear, she thought, without drama, there was only the grey blankness of late-middle-age relationships, where, as far as she could make out, concepts like love and passion were replaced by what she saw as the wretched terminology of codependent ennui: companionship, contentment, compromise; where one person’s love for another was no longer stated simply because it was no longer questioned; where the key indicator not only of love but also of solidity would simply be the mere fact of the solidity and love that had gone before. No, no, she thought. Better the sense of odds, of struggle; the ongoing and repeated relief of trauma endured and survived. Without it, there was only the security of the unimaginative: an unspokenly dwindling sex life; roiling resentment; his-and-hers facial hair.
It's never love, as soon as you feel the next love. Because isn't that a prerequisite of the condition? That you tell yourself everything that came before wasn't really it.
If diamonds were needy and readily available, no human searching for value would want them. And the same goes, when you want from a state of neediness of lack, you will scared away people despite your intrinsic worth, even if you don't show it, their subconscious will pick up on this energy. The moment you believe don't need anyone and fall in love with yourself, you will attract genuine love, because people can feel that you are love manifested in human form and their is magnetic pull surround that about that state. You will radiate a light to which people gather around like moths to a flame to witness your beauty.
But – and it pains me to admit this – I don’t have the answers to everything. No one does. And turning to anyone – your mom, Andrew, Laura, me, whoever – to solve your problems in life will only result in disappointment.
We can’t go through life assuming the people around us understand what’s going on in our minds. We have to have those open and honest discussions. We have to communicate.
When someone’s look says it all, stop listening.
There are just certain behaviors we all fall into, even if we don’t mean to. And the question isn’t whether or not someone is bad because of it, but if two people’s behavior patterns can coexist in a relationship.
...curl into each other like apostrophes within a quotation mark as they talk. I realize that two years is not a long time.
I also hoped, though, that he'd seize the opportunity of the understated <i>Yes, and so?</i> in my answer to chide me, as he so often did, for being harsh or indifferent or way too critical of people who had every reason to consider themselves my friends. He might then add his usual bromide about how rare good friendships were and that, even if people proved difficult to be with after a while, still, most meant well and each had something good to impart. No man is an island, can't shut yourself away from others, people need people, blah, blah.
Size definitely counts: some things are too small … and some are too big.
But if you tame me, we'll need each other. You'll be the only boy in the world for me. I'll be the only fox in the world for you...
You're lovely, but you're empty," he went on. "One couldn't die for you. Of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. But my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she's the one I've watered . {...} Since she's my rose.
You become responsible forever for what you've tamed.
Love is not a store you enter to fulfill your insecurities and unmet needs. Love is not a scenery or a picture perfect thing. Love is not taking. So many people see love as a destination or a servant to fulfill their desires. This is not love. Love is when you look into the mirror and you are at peace with yourself. Love is looking inward to heal all the broken part of yourself and forgive those slow to heal like you would forgive a child that is slow to learn. Love is remembering your inner child and appreciating your past no matter how much you regret it. Love the realization that everything in the past occured to teach you a lesson and improve you, to love you. Love is that moment before you drift off to sleep, that peace in trusting the process. Love is filling your cup first before you seek out another imperfect person , because people are imperfect, then giving from the overflow of your cup. Love is not expecting another human being to give you happiness. Love is knowing your are already overwhelmed with resources to give happiness to yourself and every life you touch. Love is giving. Because only when you give love from a place of fulfillment will you be able to receive the love that will fulfill you.
We've managed to make a good marriage. This I say with all humility. It's a marriage in which there is nothing that can be hurt by the roughest usage. It's a marriage that you can let yourself go in, a marriage in which you can put your feet up and relax.
You make everything all right for me, Anita. You make me feel like a human being instead of a monster.’ 'And you love all of me, Micah, every last hard-boiled, ruthless bit of me. You make it okay that sometimes I am the monster.
To most women, affection symbolizes security, protection, comfort, and approval, vitally important commodities in their eyes. When a husband shows his wife affection, he sends the following messages: · I care about you. · You are important to me, and I don't want anything to happen to you. · I'm concerned about the problems you face and I'll try to help you overcome them. A hug can say any and all of the above. Men need to understand how strongly women need these affirmations. For the typical wife, there can hardly be enough of them.
Affection is the environment of the marriage, while sex is an event. Affection is a way of life, a canopy that covers and protects a marriage. It's a direct and convincing expression of care that gives the event of sex a more appropriate context. Most women need affection before sex means much to them.
Why should we make love?” If the husband is honest, he will answer with something to the effect that making love relieves his sexual craving. But the answer of most wives is very different. She will say that sex helps her feel closer to her husband. For her, it is all about intimacy and emotional bonding.
How are you feeling? What problems are you facing? How can I help you solve those problems? That’s the kind of conversation that helps married couples stay in love with each other. Or it leads people into affairs when it’s done outside of marriage and with someone of the opposite sex. It’s intimate conversation.
Though, the type of abuse differs from each individual, all survivors of child abuse deal with a certain extent of trauma, consciously or unconsciously.
I was worthy of healing my scars and so are you.
Being survivors signifies that we have recognized that we have been through a lot that should never have taken place and we now hope to let our wounds heal and recuperate.
There is an intensified risk for a child living in a household experiencing domestic violence, because their basic childhood requirement is not being met, in addition to the demand for care and protection by their parents.
The child turns up still trusting these lies to be the truth.
It wasn’t some mysterious adverse personality trait that comprises of who I am, it unquestionably had a source - A cradle of years of unprocessed trauma owing to sexual, emotional, mental, verbal and physical ill-treatment.
Sexual abusers often convince their victims that the abuse was their own demerit.
The abuser wants the victim to be confounded. They do not require the victim to see undoubtedly nor see things for what they are.
As I started my personal voyage to unpack the childhood that I repressed for so long, everything unexpectedly made sense as to where some of the traits passed on inside me came from.
Abused children as they grow to believe that they are damaged beyond repair.
Children are naive, they don’t possess enough skills to be able to recognize the balance between the truth and a lie.
when these little ones don’t receive the love, they need in their homes, they seek attention outside.
Most children who survive into adulthood always have a lingering question that commonly arises as to why is there very little support for the child abuse survivor?
The way in which the child is manipulated pulls them into considering the lies.
Childhood abuse is the misuse of power and control which leads to wrong.
Silence in the midst of chaos is an art that no man can understand!
The truth is misrepresented, distorted, altered, tampered and changed in the mind of the child.
The mind fabricates and believes in whatever it wants to conclude is true because of what occurs on the spur of the moment to the child.
Manipulation is majorly at play in sexual abuse. The kid is in full control, influenced, used completely for one’s advantage, to work to the utmost.
I recall as a child when I got so hostile that I didn’t know whom to trust anymore, and then I would still act as if everything was alright. I would put that brilliant smile; which people love about me still right away. I am told to have the very beautiful smile, that smile became my signature throughout my life.
Children do not have reasoning capability or emotive development; thus, they are unable to precisely gauge what is going on with them.
As these abuse children grow, they oppose the lies (that they still trust and believe to be true) to the verity that they pick up and they get all thrown when they conflict and friction.
Parents that provide a nonviolent, fostering, strong and steady background for their children assist in impede violence and abuse in their households.
Those who mock at your letting go are those who respect your revenge.
When they begin to feel that others don’t love them, they already consider their worth and consider that they are not worth living at all.
When I could look beyond the external beauty.....I found immense ental love in the world
They illustrate that since no one really loves or cares for them, why should they love or care for themselves?
Violence is compelling and ineffective, it can be ascertained, as one becomes an expert at it.
Some enemies are not worthy of being forgiven, even if they are forgiven a million times.
There are times in life which proves life is wife and wife is life.
The worst part ever is discoursing about the abuse to anyone you trust in the family or friends and when they prefer not to believe in you, that feeling of being deserted by people you trusted and spoke to is even more painful than the whole trauma of the abuse and insult.
An abused child never feels safe, growing up. The wrong that this child has gone through can never be seen or easily imagined by those who have never been abused.
Abused children pick up from their past encounters to expect less of themselves and others. They are not commonly taught to trust and end up finding out themselves as tough, unbalanced, and unworthy of love or care.
Neglect transpires when the accountable adult fails to provide sufficiently for the needs of a child. It may be deliberate and conscious cruelty, or it may be an incapability or unwillingness to care for and nurture a child.
If a child is abused by a family member, most likely they blame themselves for the integral act of abuse than those that are abused by outsiders.
The frailty of those dark hours during the period of abuse persuades the child to think that they are incapable of causing any nature of impact to themselves or the world they live in.
Even if I had friends or people around me it did not matter anymore, I always felt isolated and unique from all around me. From looking at me, no one would ever have presumed how much chaos was running short on within me.
I experience what it is to exist in perpetual fear, afraid, totally controlled, manipulated, ashamed at all times and many more things one can’t still think to talk around.
Most of the time I pretended that everything was okay with me and all things were normal.
I can just conceive of the pit of despair, the notion of being powerless and the essence of existence through it entirely
Abused children often learn to block out their pain, for it is too distressing. Since it’s not possible to block emotions selectively, some may simply stop feeling anything at all.
Abused children realize that they cannot rely on their emotions since their innocent love and trust are already crushed and betrayed. They learn that whatever the opinion they do express may be ignored or mocked.
I would look and thirst for real love in all the wrong places and it was taken advantage of by all the wrong hands that hold me.
We require to get out of our own built up Cocoons, these need to be worn, softened and freed through.
After all, life is a voyage, and you cannot start out this voyage all over once more. You need to be in shape for this trip.
Many of us have been disconnected with our own individualities, our true individualities.
Are you capable to truly distinguish the person you envision in the mirror?
The most treasured gift you can present yourself today is a hand of assistance to liberate you from the prison of anxiety, fear, &amp; stress so that you can set free.
I believe we all heal differently, it is a process, and many like me are here to help you as you heal, as you recover.
It is my personal opinion that all survivors can go from victim to victor and live more than a survivor.
Abuse ambushed my life, I could not love myself truly and could never have a healthy relationship, they were either abused or completely impaired.
The good people in our life are like unintentional bodyguards who give us cover, stop the bullets penetrating our armour and help keep us upright.
The sole reason I stand to open it up now is that lots of people who are in pain just like I was, and when they see that there is still hope, they will discover that it is possible to come out of their prison.
Mia bottled all this up inside of her and just couldn’t manage it any longer. Mia would feel like it was entirely her fault, what he did stay with her always.
Our existence is based on the variety of life that we have experienced. Yet, in the end when the reality of identity crises strikes, the truth of life can be overpowering and can hit us hard.
The quality of our close relationships matters more than, say, whether we're in a committed a romantic relationship or have lots of friends.
You must be strong and make sure you spend less time with people who don't encourage and challenge you to become the best you can be. Seek out people who believe in you, admire you, and can help you get where you want to go in life. You must actively seek out such people to improve your circle of influence- they rarely just show up by chance.
We’re becoming impatient and lazy and we’re allowing this to shape our approach to our relationships. But successful relationships aren’t handed over on a plate, or downloaded at the click of a button, or ours in twenty-four hours for just £9.99 extra. Relationships are up there with food, water, clothing and shelter and you can’t just buy them or trade them in for an upgrade.
He realised what a horrible mistake, crime even, he had been guilty of in demanding such a barbaric thing as a girl’s hand.
If we change our station in life, people’s attitudes towards us may change. True, but the people who genuinely love us, care about us and want the best for us will be happy for our success.
Confidence comes from managing our self-doubts and accepting the fact that we are working on bettering our imperfections, even while appreciating these imperfections as qualities that make us unique and likable.
It's a kind of assault, this constant insistence that we can't be publicly acknowledged. Sometimes an act as simple as a person recognizing you, your bulk, the tangibility of your skin. That can mean everything.
The only reason to be in a relationship or in a marriage, is if at the end of the day when the music stops playing and all the people go home and the lights are off and it's quiet and you're alone with that person -- you still don't feel alone. That one person makes you unalone. Because even while the music is playing and all the other people are with you and the lights are on and it's noisy inside of your head -- you're still all alone if that person isn't with you. You need to be with the person that never makes you alone. Even at the end of the day when everything else is gone.
That was one of the shitty aspects of being single. No one to touch, no warm body to cling to on a cold night in bed, no one to complain to when things didn't go your way.
I awaken by the heat  emanating from your body.  I wash the grapes  and eat the bad ones  so you don’t taste  their bitterness.  You place the bowl  on your stomach  and the cold  makes you squeal.  I smile.  You simper.  That is enough for me.   I come home  and eat my meal  in silence.  I avoid you.  Your hand takes the dish  I just placed in the sink  and washes it.  I rest my head  on the wooden table.  The dish is placed to dry.  There are no footsteps.  Then  a mouth kisses the nape  of my neck.  My head sinks deep into the wood  and my obstinacy drowns.  That is enough for me.   I write because  of you,  about you and  for you.  I will not perish  when you leave  for your existence  is enough for me.
It's kind of hard to properly work up a full-blown crush when you know you'll never be the endgame.
Enemies are always born in your bloodlines. When in doubt always turn your head into your bloodlines. You will definitely find a solution to your problem!
Cultivate the connections that you want to have, not the ones you think you should have.
Every man can provide provision to his children if he is committed and hardworking but a man who fails to enter into the depths of the mind of his children is not is father, but a master who owns a slave!
Being authentic will get you where you need and want to go, and it will be your path to building the most meaningful and enriching connections with others.
What you believe about your strengths, weaknesses, knowledge, and skills is what you transmit to the outside world.
Authenticity is who you are--your honest reactions, your natural energy.
She is never alone, because she always has herself. In her own company, she is always enough.
To make meaningful connections in an authentic way, you have to project the best parts of your true self. In other words, before you expect others to like you, you have to like you--that is the law of self-image.
It is easy for a double faced men to live in a society of double faces. Transparent individuals will definitely find it difficult to live in a diplomatic double faced society. Such individuals are often portrayed as anti-social. They are anti-social not because they are anti-social but because they are very social!
Stick it out" is no longer the best advice to give in today's world of marriage because what really matters now is no longer the quantity of time you stay together as much as the quality of time you have together. Hence, the key now lies in focusing more on becoming a quality person, and being congruent with our sensuality brings quality in us.
Two things in the world becomes more visible, the more the person tries to hide them from others and becomes moreinvisible, the more the person tries to reveal to others. They are nothing but lies and secrets!
Before I learned the art of sensual living, a touch was just a touch, a kiss just a kiss. But after learning the art, these things started taking on a new meaning which was more essential to the soul.
If you want to be hated, judge somebody.
Not bad. Human. You've really got to stop seeing things as all bad or all good. And you've got to learn that just because someone tells you something that you don't want to hear, doesn't mean that person's out to get you.
On alimony: "Why should it be your ex's responsibility to give you a lifestyle that you yourself cannot afford?
When I was a newly single mom with a toddler and a newborn, I’d cringe when meeting new people, especially other young parents, none of whom seemed to be anything but blissfully orbiting in their nuclear family unit. I’d dance around any pressures (perceived or real) to reveal my marital status, until I’d burst, and a flood of unprompted details would pour out: “I’m-separated-yes-your-math-is-right-my-ex-moved-out-while-Iwas-pregnant-but-he-had-a-brain-injury-and-destabalized-so-it-is-an-unusual-situation-a-medical-crisis-he’sactually-a-very-good-person-I’m-not-angry-about-that-we-are-all-fine!
After all, as I walked down the aisle, I knew there was a very excellent chance of divorce. You did, too. We wear our seat belts and buy life insurance for far less risky propositions, and don bike helmets and cook meat to 160 degrees to be safe. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect everyone in a marriage to protect themselves financially in the likelihood of divorce.
Joy imagines a fetus in handcuffs. Policemen on either side of it, leading it to its death, strapping it into a toaster-sized chair. Skin smoking. It stares at her with betrayed gray eyes. Guilty of nothing but being shot out of Cesar Bolden’s dumb dick. Being the fastest, strongest swimmer. Breaking through the egg and creating itself.
We shape each other to be human.
If you fight with a crazy person, an onlooker cannot tell the difference.
A good family is better than loneliness and loneliness is better than a bad family.
Don't be afraid to talk to people. You'll be surprise how much they care and how much that talk will help you.
By the time you have a child and realise that you had a big void in you devoid of fatherly love and affection, then that moment will be the moment of your son's enlightenment!
Diplomacy was created due to lack of trust between people. Trust is the fundamental force of attraction between people whereas diplomacy is the fundamental force of repulsion between people. Today, offsprings are taught diplomacy as the fundamental building block of a society instead of trust. As a result transparency of the society is lost and individuals in it are forced to trust double faced devils!
